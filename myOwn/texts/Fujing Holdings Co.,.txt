OVERVIEW
We are the largest producer of potted vegetable produce in Shandong province, the
largest vegetable producing province in th e PRC in 2022, with a market share of 14.8% in
terms of sales revenue in Shandong provinc e in 2022. Meanwhile, with a sales revenue of
RMB126.7 million, the Group accounted for less than 0.01% of total sales revenue of
vegetable producers and approximately 3.1% of total sales revenue of potted vegetableproducers in China in 2022. We commenced our business of cultivation and sales of pottedvegetable produce in 2012 in Laixi, Qingdao, Shandong province, and we are one of the firstfew potted vegetable producers in Shandong province which started large scale productionof potted vegetable produce with an annual p roduction capacity of more than one million
pots in 2016. During the Track Record Period, we sold our products primarily in Shandongprovince. In view of the growing business opportunities, we extended our geographicalcoverage to Xi’an, Shaanxi province and Dalian, Liaoning province in 2019.
China’s vegetable produce market and potted vegetable produce market were both
highly fragmented with around one mil lion to two million vegetable producers and
thousands of potted vegetable producers, respectively. As potted vegetable produce is anewly-developed type of produce as compared with ordinary vegetable produce that isnormally cultivated under traditional in-g round cultivation method, in terms of sales
volume measured by net weight of vegetable, total sales volume of potted vegetable produceaccounted for less than 0.1% of total sales volume of vegetable produce in China in 2021.
During the Track Record Period, our products were marketed under our core brand
‘‘富景農業’’ which included 29 potted vegetable prod uce species. As in line with the industry
practice, we sell our potted vegetable produce primarily through a network of distributorsin the PRC which then on-sell our products to over 1,000 customers in the Shandongprovince, Xi’an and Dalian, the majority of which are hotels and restaurants.
For ensuring our potted vegetable produce is of good quality and meet the relevant
safety requirements, all of th em are grown in greenhouses in our cultivation facilities, and
we do not purchase potted vegetable produce from other producers. As at the LatestPracticable Date, we had been accredited wit h Certificate of Pollution-free Agricultural
Products* ( 無公害農產品證書) issued by Qingdao Agricultural Rural Bureau* ( 青島市農業
農村局) in respect of the potted vegetable produce cultivated at our Laixi Facility.SUMMARY

OUR CULTIVATION AND PRODUCTION
We cultivate our vegetable produce in pots which contain our specially formulated
organic substrates. Such organic substrates are made primarily from raw materials such as
cow manure, fungi residue and peanut shells that are proportioned, mixed and processedthrough high-temperature fermentation. Compared to vegetable produce grown in open
fields, using such organic substrates enables our potted vegetable produce to be cultivatedwith ideal nutrients for healthy growth, and prevents the risks of contamination andpollution. We apply an industrial cultivation method to produce our potted vegetableproduce. Such cultivation method requires the use of enclosed greenhouses together withthe application of our horticultural know-how and equipment in connection with pestcontrol, heat preservation, ventilation and/or shading of sunlight in order to create anappropriate and ideal microclimate environment for the growth of our potted vegetableproduce. The entire cultivation process of potted vegetable produce commencing fromprocurement of raw materials to delivery of our products takes approximately 40 days to 50days, depending on the species of vegetable produce cultivated and the season ofcultivation. For details, please refer to the p aragraph headed ‘‘Business — Cultivation of
our potted vegetable produce — Cultivation process’’.SUMMARY

RAW MATERIALS, SUPPLIE RS AND SUBCONTRACTORS
Raw materials
Our raw materials primarily include (i) components of organic substrates; (ii) seeds;
and (iii) fertilisers (such as foliar fertilise rs) and biopesticides (such as matrine). We
typically enter into purchase agreements with our suppliers which generally specify the type,
quantity and/or quality specifications of raw materials, terms of delivery and credit period.The prices of our raw materials are fixed in the purchase agreements.
Our suppliers
In FY2020, FY2021, FY2022 and 5M2023, purch ases from our largest supplier in each
year accounted for approximately 70.3%, 62.9%, 50.8% and 52.8%, respectively, of ourtotal purchases. For the same periods, our five largest suppliers in each year combined
accounted for approximately 94.3%, 99.7%, 99.7% and 99.9%, respectively, of our totalpurchases. Our purchase from our five larg est suppliers in each year increased by
approximately RMB9.4 million (or 26.6%) from approximately RMB35.3 million in
FY2020 to approximately RMB44.7 million in FY2021. The said increases from FY2020 toFY2021 were mainly due to the increase in our cultivation capacity and the volume of ouractual cultivation output in the corresponding period. Our purchase from our five largestsuppliers in each year decreased by appro ximately RMB4.9 million (or 11.0%) from
approximately RMB44.7 million in FY2021 t o approximately RMB39.8 million in FY2022.
The said decreases was mainly due to the adverse impact of the COVID-19 epidemic whichaffected our Shandong market during FY2022. Our purchases from our five largestsuppliers increased by approximately RMB 3.4 million (or 28.6%) from approximately
RMB11.9 million in 5M2022 to approximately RMB15.3 million in 5M2023. The saidincreases was mainly due to the increase in th e volume of our actual cultivation output in
the corresponding period. For details, please refer to the paragraph headed ‘‘Business —Raw materials, suppliers and subcontractors — Suppliers’’.
Our subcontractors
We engage by entering into standard labour subcontracting agreements ( 勞務外包合作
協議書) with Independent Third Parties for p erforming simple labour work such as
watering, sowing and transporting in the cultivation process under our management andsupervision at our cultivation facilities. Our Directors believe that adopting such
arrangement would provide us with more flexibility in management, reduce our
administrative workload and allow us to manag e effectively our cultivation process and
meet our demand for workforce in a timely manner to cope with our recent expansion. Italso allows our experienced staff to focus on the quality control procedures to uphold thequality of our products and conduct testing for the refinement of our current cultivationmethods and techniques which are our core competitive advantages, and focus less onSUMMARY

THE COVER OF THIS DOCUMENT.Our revenue dropped from a pproximately RMB154.9 mi llion in FY2021 to RMB126.7
million in FY2022. Such tempor ary decrease was mainly du e to the series of lockdown
measures in Dalian and various areas in Shandong province due to the COVID-19 epidemicsince March 2022. Operation of Laixi Facility, our largest cultivation base, was suspended
for more than one month between March and April 2022. Furthermore, due to theprolonged lockdown since March 2022 that restricted the operation of some of our end-usercustomers in the Shandong province and Dalian, it took several months for our overall salesto pickup and gradually resumed to normal level in August 2022.
Our revenue increased from approximately RMB30.3 million in 5M2022 to
approximately RMB56.2 million in 5M2023. T he said increases was mainly due to the
increase in the volume of our actual cultivat ion output in the corresponding period as our
business operation was no longer affected by COVID-19 epidemic in 5M2023.
We incurred [REDACTED] of approximately RMB [REDACTED] ,
RMB [REDACTED] ,R M B [REDACTED] and RMB [REDACTED] for FY2020, FY2021,
FY2022 and 5M2023, respectively.
Our gross profit increased by approximately RMB13.3 million (or 23.9%) from
approximately RMB55.6 million in FY2020 t o approximately RMB68.9 million in FY2021.
Such increase was primarily attributable to the increase in the sales volume of our pottedvegetable produce; effect of which was partially offset by the increase in our cost of sales,which was in line with the increase in sales volume of our potted vegetable produce.
Our gross profit decreased by approximately RMB13.1 million (or 18.9%) from
approximately RMB68.9 million in FY2021 t o approximately RMB55.9 million in FY2022.
Such decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in the sales volume of our potted
vegetable produce due to the temporary adverse impact of the COVID-19 epidemic whichseriously affected our Shandong market during FY2022.
Our gross profit increased by approximately RMB12.3 million (or 97.9%) from
approximately RMB12.6 million in 5M2022 t o approximately RMB25.0 million in 5M2023.
Such increase was primarily attributable to the increase in the sales volume of our pottedvegetable produce; effect of which was partially offset by the increase in our cost of sales,which was in line with the increase in sales volume of our potted vegetable produce.
Our net profit increased from appr oximately RMB43.8 million in FY2020 to
approximately RMB47.3 million in FY2021, whi ch was primarily due to the increase of
our revenue as a result of our increase in cult ivation capacity during the corresponding
period.
As a result of the resurgence of the COV ID-19 epidemic in March 2022 and the
temporary suspension of our cultivation fac ilities, we recorded a decrease in revenue for
FY2022 as compared to that of the FY2021. Although the demand of our potted vegetableproduce gradually resume normal in the second half of 2022, we recorded a decrease in netprofit for FY2022 due to the decrease in revenue in the first half of 2022 as a result of thetemporary adverse impact of the COVID-19 epidemic to our revenue in the first half of2022. Our net profit decreased from app roximately RMB47.3 million in FY2021 to

Our net cash generated from operating acti vities remained positive during the Track
Record Period, and we recorded a net cash generated from operating activities ofapproximately RMB51.6 million in FY2020 main ly because we shortened the credit terms
offered to our major customers in 2019 and FY 2020. We recorded a net cash generated from
operating activities of approximately R MB33.8 million in FY2021 mainly because of our
operating profit before working capital c hanges of approximately RMB59.0 million as
partially offset by our payment of [REDACTED] of approximately RMB [REDACTED] .W e
recorded a net cash generated from operating activities of approximately RMB50.2 million
in FY2022, mainly because of our operating profit before working capital changes ofapproximately RMB49.9 million as partially offs et by the increase in biological assets and
inventories of approximately RMB4.0 m illion and RMB1.4 million, respectively. We
recorded a net cash generated from operating activities of approximately RMB33.9 million
in 5M2023, mainly because of our operating profit before working capital changes ofapproximately RMB24.2 million as partially offset by the increase in prepayments andother receivables of approximately RMB0. 4 million. Our net cash used in investing
activities decreased from approximately RMB55.2 million in FY2020 to approximately
RMB16.8 million in FY2021, which was prim arily due to the renovation of the office
premises and other maintenance and improvement works in our Laixi Facility. Our net cashused in investing activities decreased to a pproximately RMB1.1 million in FY2022, which
was primarily due to the fact that we have comp leted most of the renovation, maintenance
and improvement works in our Laixi Facility bef ore FY2022. Our net cash used in investing
activities increased to approximately RMB1 4.5 million in 5M2023, which was primarily due
to payments for investment properties o f approximately RMB12.0 million for the
renovation of our Laixi Land and Buildings for Investment Purpose conducted duringthe same period.SUMMARY

Our gross profit margin decreased from 4 5.8% in FY2020 to approximately 44.5% in
FY2021 mainly because of the increase in cu ltivation overheads from approximately
RMB4.2 million for FY2020 to RMB6.1 millio n for FY2021 which a re predominantly
depreciation charges. Such increase in cultivation overheads was due to the significantcapital expenditure on our cultivation fac ilities including, such as, greenhouses and
infrastructure which amounted to appro ximately RMB44.4 million and RMB14.4 million
for FY2020 and FY2021 respectively. Such dec rease in gross profit margin was primarily
the result of the increase in our cost of sales by approximately RMB20.2 million (or 30.6%)between FY2020 and FY2021, which overwhelmed the increase in our revenue byapproximately RMB33.5 million (or 27.6%) during the same periods.
Our gross profit margin decreased from approximately 44.5% in FY2021 to
approximately 44.1% in FY2022 because the percentage drop of our cultivationoverheads by 10.0% is less than the 17.7% drop of overall cost of sales between FY2021and FY2022. As a result, our cultivation overheads accounted for a larger proportion ofcost of sales in FY2022, leading to lower gross profit margin in FY2022.
Our gross profit margin increased from approximately 41.7% in 5M2022 to
approximately 44.4% in 5M2023 mainly because of the increase in revenue from the sale
of our potted vegetable produce by approx imately RMB26.0 million (or 85.8%) from
5M2022 to 5M2023, which overwhelmed the increase in our cost of sales by approximatelyRMB13.6 million (or 77.2%) during the same period.
Our net profit margin decreased fro m approximately 36.1% in FY2020 to
approximately 30.5% in FY2021. Such decrease was primarily the result of (i) increase in
our[REDACTED] by approximately RMB [REDACTED] million (or [REDACTED] %); and
(ii) decrease in our other income by approximately RMB3.4 million (or 73.4%) in thecorresponding period.
Our net profit margin decreased fro m approximately 30.5% in FY2021 to
approximately 25.1% in FY2022. Such decrease was primarily the result of the decreasein revenue from the sale of our potted vegetable produce by approximately RMB28.3million (or 18.2%) from FY2021 to FY2022 due to the temporary adverse impact of the
COVID-19 epidemic which seriously affect ed our Shandong and Dalian market during
FY2022.
We have a net profit margin of 32.7% in 5M2023, while we recorded a net loss in
5M2022, which was primarily the result of the increase in revenue from the sale of our
potted vegetable produce by approximate ly RMB26.0 million (or 85.8%) from 5M2022 to
5M2023 as our business operation was no longer affected by COVID-19 epidemic in5M2023.SUMMARY

Our biological assets consist of potted veg etable produce stated at fair value less
estimated cost to sell as at the end of reporting period. The fair value has been assessed bySavills, a firm of independent qualified professi onal valuers not connected with us, which
has appropriate qualificati ons and experiences in valuatio n of biological assets, with
reference to market prices, scrap rate, cultivation areas, species, growing conditions andcost incurred. We are required under HKFRS to r ecognise such changes under ‘‘net changes
in fair value of biological assets’’. This line item represents fair value changes of ourbiological assets due to the changes in physical attributes and market prices of ourbiological assets, in particular, our potted vegetable produce at the end of each of the TrackRecord Period. Cost approach is adopted for these newly planted potted vegetable produce,and market approach is adopted for mature potted vegetable produce since observablebiological transformation has taken place. Please refer to the paragraphs headed ‘‘RiskFactors — Our results of operations are subject to biological asset fair value adjustments,which are subject to a few assumptions’’ and ‘‘Financial Information — Valuation ofbiological assets — Key assumptions and inputs’’, respectively, in this document for furtherdetails.

According to paragraphs 12 and 13 of HKAS 41 ‘‘Agriculture’’ issued by the Hong
Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (‘‘ HKICPA ’’), (i) a biological asset shall be
measured at the end of each reporting period at its fair value less costs to sell, except wherethe fair value cannot be measured reliably; and (ii) agricultural produce harvested from anentity’s biological assets shall be measured a t its fair value less costs to sell at the point of
harvest. The resultant changes in the fair value adjustment between each reporting periodare recognised as gain or loss and charged to ‘‘ne t changes in fair value of biological assets’’
in our consolidated statements of profit or loss. However, the fair value of potted vegetablesthat are planted and sold within the same financial period results in no net changes in fairvalue of biological assets recognised during that reporting period.SUMMARY

According to paragraphs 97 of HKAS 1 ‘‘Presentation of Financial Statements’’ issued
by the HKICPA, if the expense involved is material to the consolidated financial
statements, the Group should disclose its nature and amount separately. Accordingly, thecost of the unsold vegetable produce resulting from the temporary suspension of ourGroup’s cultivation facilities or the impositi on of lock down and travel restrictions were
accounted for write-off of biological assets and were charged to profit or loss as a separateitem given it was abnormal amounts of wastage. In FY2022, we wrote off certain of ourbiological assets of approximately RMB4.6 million which represented the unsold vegetableproduce as a result of the temporary suspens ion of our facilities due to the outbreak of
COVID-19 epidemic from March 2022 to April 2022. Most of the unsold potted vegetableproduce from our Laixi Facility was donated to th e government for the distribution to the
local residents for their consumption d uring the lockdown period of the COVID-19
epidemic in FY2022.
The fair value of our biological assets was approximately RMB9.4 million, RMB9.8
million, RMB8.4 million and RMB7.5 million a s at 31 December 2020, 31 December 2021,
31 December 2022 and 31 May 2023, respectively. The increase in the fair value of our
biological assets from 31 December 2020 to 31 December 2021 was primarily due to theincrease in the number of pots of vegetable produce in our cultivation facilities at the
relevant time. The slightly decrease in the fair value of our biological assets as at 31December 2022 was primarily due to the decre ase in the number of pots of vegetable
produce in our cultivation facilities as at 31 De cember 2022. The slightly decrease in the fair
value of our biological assets as at 31 May 2023 was primarily due to the decrease in thenumber of pots of vegetable produce in our cul tivation facilities as at 31 May 2023. Please

3. The estimated loss of potential sales revenue is calc ulated based on the average s elling price of our potted
vegetable produce in Shandong province of approximately RMB15.0 per pot in FY2022
In February and March 2020, in light of the closure of some hotels and restaurants and
the government policy of home isolation and quarantine which restricted the movement oflocal residents, as a temporary and extraord inary arrangement, our distributors sold
524,900 pots of our potted vegetable produce to residents in local residential estates throughproperty management companies, accounting for revenue of our Group of approximatelyRMB7.8 million (or 6.5% of our total revenue in FY2020). In view of the above and thatour potted vegetable produce is targeted to food and beverage industry rather thanhousehold daily consumption, such temporary and extraordinary arrangement was ceasedafter March 2020.
The series of lockdown measures in Dalian and various areas in Shandong province
due to the COVID-19 epidemic in 2022 has temporary adverse impact on our business inFY2022. Our revenue derived from Laixi Fac ility and the Dalian Facility has dropped by
approximately RMB26.8 million and RMB0.5 million, or 19.0% and 7.2% between FY2021and FY2022 respectively. Such lockdowns have more serious impact on our business andfinancial performance than lockdown in p rior years due to the following reasons:
(i) the lockdown affected our Laixi Facility and the Shandong market which
accounts for most of our revenue and lasted for around one month;
(ii) unlike the first lockdown in 2020 when our cultivation facilities were still in
operation, during the lockdown in 2022 distributors were not allowed to pick uppotted vegetable produce from us and no sales took place during the lockdown,resulting in direct loss of unsold vegetable produce of approximately 557,000 potsSUMMARY

million during the lockdown. We wrote off o ur biological assets of approximately
RMB4.6 million as a result; and
(iii) the COVID-19 epidemic was particularly serious in the Shandong province in
March 2022. Hence, during the initial period of our resumption of operation ofLaixi Facility in April 2022, some of the loc kdown and travel restrictions were still
partially in force in various parts of the Shandong province. Due to the prolongedlockdown in 2022, it took several months for our overall sales to pickup andgradually resume to normal level.
Between March and July 2022, our revenue in Shandong province and Dalian fell short
of the revenue in the same period in 2021 by approximately RMB26.6 million and RMB1.0million respectively. Such shortfall includes the estimated direct loss of potential sales
revenue for unsold potted vegetable produce of approximately RMB8.2 million andRMB0.1 million for Laixi Facility and Dalian Facil ity respectively as explained in the table
on pages [10.1] and [10.2]. By August 2022, our sales have fully resumed and we recorded arevenue of approximately RMB17.2 million i n August 2022, which exceeded our revenue of
approximately RMB16.1 million in August 2021 . We recorded a revenue of approximately
RMB54.2 million from September 2022 to D ecember 2022, which is comparable to the
revenue of approximately RMB54.6 million we r ecorded during the same period in 2021. As
confirmed by the Directors, most of the hotels and restaurants end-user customers of theGroup’s distributors have resumed normal operation since August 2022. The Group’soperations and financial position since Septe mber 2022 was no longer materially affected by
the COVID-19 epidemic.
The PRC government has substantially lifte d its COVID-19 prevention and control
policies since December 2022. Our business continued to recover from the impact ofCOVID-19 outbreak in 2023, as our business operation was no longer affected by COVID-19 epidemic. We recorded a revenue of approx imately RMB56.2 million in 5M2023, which
slightly exceeded the revenue of approximat ely RMB55.9 million for the five months ended
31 May 2021. Our Directors are of the view that it is unlikely that the COVID-19 pandemicwill have a material adverse impact on our business going forward. Our Directorsconfirmed that there was no material adverse impact on our operation, our sales to ourcustomers, our suppliers and our subcontractors in relation to our business due to theCOVID-19 epidemic during the Track Record Period and up to the Latest Practicable Date.We had adopted additional internal control and hygiene measures since the outbreak ofCOVID-19 epidemic.
However, there is no assurance that there will not be any direct or indirect adverse
impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations arising from any effecton the PRC economy or other parts of the world as a result of the continuance of theCOVID-19 outbreak. For details, please refer to the paragraph headed ‘‘Risk Factors —Risks relating to our business — The recent outbreak of COVID-19 has caused, and maycontinue to cause, damage to th e economy and as a result may adversely affect our business,
