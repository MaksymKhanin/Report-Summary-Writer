OVERVIEW
We are a leading and rapidly growing livestock and poultry breeding and farming
enterprise in China, focusing on the breeding and farming of pigs and yellow-featheredbroilers. With a vertically integrated industry chain covering the breeding and farming of pigsand yellow-feathered broilers and feed production, we are committed to becoming an excellenthigh-end food manufacturing enterprise with full industry chain capabilities in China. Apartfrom the Self-operated Farm model, we also adopt the Family Farm model, under which wecooperate primarily with individual owners of farms which are Independent Third Parties inour pigs and broiler production. Our results of operation have grown rapidly since ourinception, with an increase in the sales volume of our pigs by more than 100 times in the last10 years. As at 31 May 2023, our business footprint covered 39 cities across 13 provinces andautonomous regions in China. According to the Frost & Sullivan Report, China’s pig marketis highly fragmented, with the top three players each accounting for a market share of 7.7%,2.6% and 1.7%, respectively, in terms of sales volume of pigs for 2022; we ranked sixth amongall pig suppliers in China in terms of sales volume of pigs with a market share of 0.8%.According to the same report, for 2022, we ranked third among all yellow-feathered broilersuppliers in China in terms of sales volume of yellow-feathered broilers with a market shareof 2.1% while the top player had a market share of 28.2%.
Our business consists of three segments, namely pig, poultry, and ancillary products,
which mainly include feed ingredients. Products of our pig segment mainly include markethogs, breeding pigs, market piglets and boar semen. Products of our poultry segment mainlyinclude yellow-feathered broilers and chicks. In addition to breeding and farming of pigs andyellow-feathered broilers at our own facilities, we also cooperate with farm owners in pig andpoultry production. For 2020, 2021, 2022 and the five months ended 31 May 2022 and 2023,our pig segment contributed to 70.6%, 72.4%, 78.1%, 75.2% and 78.8% of our total revenue,our poultry segment contributed to 28.1%, 26.4%, 21.4%, 24.3% and 19.9% of our totalrevenue, and our ancillary products segment contributed to 1.3%, 1.2%, 0.5%, 0.6% and 1.3%of our total revenue, respectively.
Our farming business models
Our pig farming is conducted under the No. 2 Family Farm, No. 1 Family Farm and
Self-operated Farm models:
 No. 2 Family Farm model . It is a model under which we cooperate with farm owners
to raise sows, and to produce weaned piglets that are fattened either in the No. 2Family Farm or nearby No. 1 Family Farms. For 2020, 2021, 2022 and the fivemonths ended 31 May 2022 and 2023, revenue generated from the sales of pigsraised under the No. 2 Family Farm model amounted to RMB1,596.6 million,RMB1,478.7 million, RMB1,763.1 million, RMB500.9 million and RMB760.1million which accounted for 27.8%, 20.6%, 15.0%, 14.5% and 15.2% of our totalrevenue from the sales of pigs, respectively.
 No. 1 Family Farm model . It is a model under which farm owners fatten our weaned
piglets. For 2020, 2021, 2022 and the five months ended 31 May 2022 and 2023,revenue generated from the sales of pigs raised under the No. 1 Family Farm modelamounted to RMB3,626.1 million, RMB3,935.0 million, RMB8,064.7 million,RMB2,281.2 million and RMB3,464.3 million, which accounted for 63.1%, 54.9%,68.7%, 66.3% and 69.0% of our total revenue from the sales of pigs, respectively.SUMMARY
–1–“THIS DOCUMENT IS IN DRAFT FORM, INCOMPLETE AND SUBJECT TO CHANGE AND THAT THE INFORMATION MUST
BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE SECTION HEADED “WARNING” ON THE COVER OF THIS DOCUMENT.” Self-operated Farm model . It is a model under which we build the farm and employ
labour force to carry out scaled breeding, fattening and other related process. Thismodel has the advantage of high level of centralisation and standardisation, whichallows us to implement an efficient management system. For 2020, 2021, 2022 andthe five months ended 31 May 2022 and 2023, revenue generated from the sales ofpigs raised under the Self-operated Farm model amounted to RMB525.0 million,RMB1,754.4 million, RMB1,917.2 million, RMB661.5 million and RMB789.9million, which accounted for 9.1%, 24.5%, 16.3%, 19.2% and 15.8% of our totalrevenue from the sales of pigs, respectively.
For details, please refer to the section headed “Business – Production – Pig Production”
in this document.
We breed and select chicken breeders, and hatch fertile eggs in our own poultry farms and
hatcheries. For broiler farming, we adopt the Poultry Family Farm model and Poultry FarmingBase model:
 Poultry Family Farm model . It is a model under which family farms provide the land
and facilities and raise the yellow-feathered broilers according to our standards,while we provide chicks, feed, medicines and technical support. For 2020, 2021,2022 and the five months ended 31 May 2022 and 2023, revenue generated from thesales of yellow-feathered broilers raised under the Poultry Family Farm modelamounted to RMB2,074.0 million, RMB2,419.0 million, RMB3,028.7 million,RMB1,049.8 million and RMB1,176.0 million, which accounted for 95.9%, 96.0%,97.3%, 97.2% and 95.5% of our total revenue from the sales of yellow-featheredbroilers for the same periods, respectively.
 Poultry Farming Base model . It is a model under which we build facilities by
ourselves and lease the land and facilities to farm owners while the farm ownersraise the yellow-feathered broilers. For 2020, 2021, 2022 and the five months ended31 May 2022 and 2023, revenue generated from the sale of yellow-feathered broilersraised under the Poultry Farming Base model amounted to RMB50.7 million,RMB51.9 million, RMB28.4 million, RMB9.4 million and RMB34.2 million whichaccounted for 2.0%, 1.8%, 0.9%, 0.9% and 2.8% of the total revenue from the salesof yellow-feathered broilers for the same periods, respectively.
For details, please refer to the section headed “Business – Production – Poultry
Production” in this document.
Contract Farming
We cooperate with a wide base of farm owners to produce pigs and poultries under our
family farm models. For 2020, 2021, 2022 and the five months ended 31 May 2022 and 2023,revenue from the sale of pigs and yellow-feathered broilers raised under the family farmmodels amounted to RMB7,347.4 million, RMB7,884.6 million, RMB12,884.9 million,RMB3,841.3 million and RMB5,434.6 million, representing 90.2%, 79.6%, 85.7%, 83.8% and85.4% of our total revenue during the same periods, respectively. For details, please refer tothe section headed “Business – Production – Contract Farming” in this document.

BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE SECTION HEADED “WARNING” ON THE COVER OF THIS DOCUMENT.”Our Business Model and Products
We primarily engage in the breeding and farming of pigs and yellow-feathered broilers.
Our vertically integrated business model covers the industry value chain from feed production,breeding, multiplication, farming to sales of pigs and yellow-feathered broilers, which gives usa high degree of control over food quality and safety. Furthermore, we cooperate with farmowners in our pig and poultry production. We provide farm owners with quality breeding pigsand yellow-feathered chicks, techniques, supervision, training and support, while farm ownersprovide land and facilities and breed and/or raise pigs and poultry for contractual fees. Thisasset-light family farm model allows us to expand rapidly and equips us with the scale tocontinuously optimise our standardised farming system and enhance our technological edge. Italso incentivises farm owners by improving their livelihood, thereby creating a mutuallybeneficial cycle. We sell our pigs and poultry products and ancillary products generated in thecourse of production. The diagram below illustrates our business model:

By leveraging our strengths in the breeding and farming of pigs and poultry, we plan to
extend our business to downstream sectors, including the slaughtering and processing of pigsand poultry, the production and sales of fresh pork and chicken meat and processed meatproducts. Our vertically integrated business model would allow us a high degree of controlover quality and safety across the entire value chain, spanning from sourcing feed ingredientsto production and sale of final food products. We believe the traceability of the final foodproducts will instil consumers’ confidence in our food safety and quality and allow us to builda high-end food brand. As at the Latest Practicable Date, we had a food processing plant projectin progress in Yibin City, Sichuan Province, of which the slaughterhouse is expected to becomplete in the third quarter of 2023 with a target annual slaughtering capacity of over threemillion heads of pigs. We have also established a joint venture with Tönnies (one of the largestintegrated meat product enterprise in Germany) and are constructing a slaughterhouse inMeishan City, Sichuan Province with a target initial annual slaughtering capacity of over twomillion heads of pigs. For details, please refer to the section headed “Business – Our BusinessModel and Products – Expansion into Food Processing Business” in this document.
Price Fluctuation Management
We have adopted diverse means to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in pig, broiler and
feed prices on our business operation.
For our pig segment, we have taken the following means: (i) conducting market survey
to collect market information on pigs; (ii) selling pigs through the Dekon Group Pig SellingSystem ( ᅃੰණྠ͛ሥቖਯӻ୕ ) by way of bidding to obtain feedback on market demand and
prices to ensure we can obtain higher sales revenue; (iii) entering into contract with our keycustomers and agree with our key customers on key sales terms such as the quantity of pigs tobe sold and sales rewards; and (iv) using a combination of futures and options to hedge the pigprice fluctuations. Please refer to the section headed “Business – Hedging” in this documentfor details.
For our poultry segment, we have taken the following means to manage the price
fluctuation. Based on the statistical analysis of research data on the supply and demand ofbroilers, our sales department forecast the market price for broilers on an annual and monthlybasis. According to the market forecast, we formulate the following year’s broiler productionplan in December every year. We also adjust our production plan according to short-termmarket fluctuations.
We have also adopted diverse means to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in feed prices,
including flexibly adjusting feed formula while adhering to nutritional standards, diversifyingour feed ingredients so that the price fluctuation of one ingredient would not exert materialimpact on our feed price, maintaining diversified supply channels and conducting raw materialprocurement with commodity futures. We use a combination of futures and options hedge thefeed price fluctuations. Please refer to the section headed “Business – Hedging” in thisdocument for details.

COMPETITION
We mainly compete with pig and yellow-feathered broiler breeding and farming
companies in the PRC. According to the Frost & Sullivan Report, unlike the low entry barriersfor small-scale farmers, large-scale pig and poultry breeding and farming enterprises face highbarriers in terms of management, funds, technologies, channels, talents, etc. According to theFrost & Sullivan Report, for 2022, we were one of the top ten breeding pig providers in thePRC in terms of sales volume of breeding pigs. According to the Frost & Sullivan Report,China’s pig market is highly fragmented, with the top three players each accounting for amarket share of 7.7%, 2.6% and 1.7%, respectively, in terms of sales volume of pigs for 2022;we ranked sixth among all pig suppliers in China in terms of sales volume of pigs with a marketshare of 0.8%. According to the same report, for 2022, we ranked third among allyellow-feathered broiler suppliers in China in terms of sales volume of yellow-featheredbroilers with a market share of 2.1% while the top player had a market share of 28.2%. It isexpected that the trend of industry concentration will continue to accelerate due to growingscrutiny over food safety matters. Competition for our products in the PRC is primarily basedon large-scale batch production capability, brand recognition, quality, genetic traits, price,marketing strategies as well as distribution network. For details of our competitive advantages,please refer to the section headed “Business – Our Competitive Strengths” in this document.For challenges and threat we encounter during our business operation, please refer to thesection headed “Industry Overview” in this document.SUMMARY

–1 0–“THIS DOCUMENT IS IN DRAFT FORM, INCOMPLETE AND SUBJECT TO CHANGE AND THAT THE INFORMATION MUST
BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE SECTION HEADED “WARNING” ON THE COVER OF THIS DOCUMENT.”Our business has grown rapidly during the Track Record Period. Our revenue increased
by 21.6% from RMB8,145.3 million for 2020 to RMB9,901.6 million for 2021 and furtherincreased by 51.9% to RMB15,037.0 million for 2022. Our revenue increased by 38.9% fromRMB4,581.2 million for the five months ended 31 May 2022 to RMB6,362.2 million for thesame period of 2023. We recorded a profit of RMB3,608.4 million, a loss of RMB3,172.7million, a profit of RMB909.8 million, a loss of RMB1,548.6 million and a loss of RMB2,184.5million for 2020, 2021 and 2022 and the five months ended 31 May 2022 and 2023,respectively.
Our revenue is significantly affected by the average selling price and the sales volume of
our products. We operate in a highly fragmented and competitive industry. Our primaryproducts are our pig and poultry products which are commodities. The selling prices of our pigand poultry products are subject to significant market price fluctuations. Selling pricesgenerally fluctuate with market conditions, including supply and demand, outbreaks ofdiseases and government policies. For example, selling prices for our pig products have beencyclical over the years, reflecting changes in market supply and demand, and the supply of pigsis affected by, among others, government policies and outbreaks of diseases. See “IndustryOverview – Pig Cycle” and “Industry Overview – China’s yellow-feathered broiler market –market size of yellow-feathered broilers” for more information on historical fluctuations of pigand poultry prices.

Our total gross loss was RMB597.2 million and RMB382.9 million in the five months
ended 31 May 2022 and 31 May 2023, respectively. Our overall gross profit margin was -13.0%and -6.0% in the five months ended 31 May 2022 and 2023, respectively. We recordedimproved gross profit and gross profit margin for the five months ended 31 May 2023 ascompared with the corresponding period in 2022 mainly due to the relatively high averageselling price of our market hogs for the five months ended 31 May 2023 as compared with thecorresponding period in 2022.
Our total gross profit increased by 170.7% from RMB764.1 million in 2021 to
RMB2,068.2 million in 2022. Our overall gross profit margin was 7.7% and 13.8% in 2021 and2022, respectively. The increase in our overall gross profit and gross profit margin wasprimarily due to the increase in average selling prices of our market hogs. The average sellingprice of our market hogs per head increased by 9.8% from 2021 to 2022 even though theaverage selling price for market hogs in China per kg decreased from 2021 to 2022, primarilydue to the fact that the average selling price for our market hogs per kg increased by 7.0% fromRMB17.1/kg to RMB18.3/kg as we sold more market hogs in the second half of 2022 when themarket price was relatively high.
Our total gross profit decreased by 75.8% from RMB3,163.9 million for 2020 to
RMB764.1 million for 2021. Our overall gross profit margin was 38.8% and 7.7% for 2020 and2021, respectively. The decreases in our overall gross profit and gross profit margin wereprimarily due to the decrease in average selling prices of our market hogs driven by moresupply of market hogs becoming available in 2021.
Our profit/(loss) for the year/period was a net profit of RMB3,608.4 million, a net loss
of RMB3,172.7 million, a net profit of RMB909.8 million and a net loss of RMB1,548.6million and a net loss of RMB2,184.5 million for 2020, 2021 and 2022, and for the five monthsended 31 May 2022 and 2023, respectively. During the Track Record Period, our profit/(loss)for the year was primarily affected by the following factors: (i) gross profit; (ii) changes in fairvalue of biological assets; and (iii) our administrative expense. We recorded gains arising fromchanges in fair value of biological assets of RMB1,295.7 million for 2020 primarily becausea significant increase in the stock volume and in the appraisal value of pigs. We recorded lossesarising from changes in fair value of biological assets of RMB2,753.5 million in 2021 primarilydue to the decrease in the average selling price of market hogs, which was partially offset bythe increase in the stock volume of our pigs and poultry products in 2021. We recorded gainsarising from changes in fair value of biological assets of RMB304.8 million in 2022 primarilybecause of the significant increase in appraisal value of the pigs as at 31 December 2022arising from the increase in price and stock volume. We recorded losses arising from changesin fair value of biological assets of RMB419.3 million in the five months ended 31 May 2022primarily due to the decrease in appraisal value of the pigs as at 31 May 2022 arising from thedecrease in market price, which was slightly offset by an increase in stock volume. Werecorded losses arising from changes in fair value of biological assets of RMB1,202.4 millionin the five months ended 31 May 2023 primarily because of the significant decrease inappraisal value of the pigs as at 31 May 2023 arising from the decrease in market price, whichwas slightly offset by an increase in stock volume. Our administrative expenses increased by27.0% from RMB700.3 million for 2020 to RMB889.6 million for 2021 and further increasedby 19.0% to RMB1,058.2 million for 2022 and increased by 26.4% from RMB387.1 million forthe five months ended 31 May 2022 to RMB489.3 million for the corresponding period in2023, which was primarily due to (i) the increase in our depreciation and amortisation inconnection with our office buildings and office equipment; (ii) the increase in our insurancecost as we purchased more insurance to cover the price drop and deaths of our pig and poultryproducts; and (iii) the increase in our research and development costs.

Our net assets decreased from RMB7,159.7 million as at 31 December 2020 to
RMB4,132.8 million as at 31 December 2021, mainly due to loss for the year of RMB3,172.7million, which was partially offset by the issue of our ordinary shares in the amount ofRMB120.0 million. Our net loss for 2021 was primarily due to the loss from changes in fairvalue of biological assets in the amount of RMB2,753.5 million. Our net assets increased toRMB5,063.8 million as at 31 December 2022, mainly due to profit for the year of RMB909.8million as well as capital contribution from non-controlling interest in the amount of RMB18.6million. Our net profit for 2022 was primarily attributable to our gross profit in the amount ofRMB2,068.2 million. Our net assets decreased to RMB2,915.8 million as at 31 May 2023,mainly due to the loss from changes in fair value of biological assets in the amount ofRMB1,202.4 million.
We had net current assets of RMB1,828.8 million, net current liabilities of RMB258.2
million, and net current assets of RMB130.2 million and net current liabilities of RMB2,683.8million as at 31 December 2020, 2021 and 2022, and 31 May 2023, respectively.
We recorded net current assets of RMB130.2 million as at 31 December 2022 and net
current liabilities of RMB2,683.8 million as at 31 May 2023, the change was primarily due to(i) a significant decrease in current biological assets due to low pig and poultry prices in thefive months ended 31 May 2023 and accordingly a decrease in the valuation of our biologicalassets and (ii) a significant decrease in cash and cash equivalents and restricted deposits, as weused more cash in our business operations.
We recorded net current liabilities of RMB258.2 million as at 31 December 2021 and net
current assets of RMB130.2 million as of 31 December 2022, the change was primarily due to(i) a significant increase in current biological assets which is primarily due to the increase inthe stock volume of our pig and poultry products; and (ii) a significant increase in cash andcash equivalents and restricted deposits, which is a result of an improvement in our operatingperformance.
Our net current assets decreased from RMB1,828.8 million as at 31 December 2020 to net
current liabilities of RMB258.2 million as at 31 December 2021, primarily due to (i) anincrease in interest-bearing borrowings as we scaled our business in 2021; (ii) an increase intrade and bills payables as we increased the size of our breeding pigs in order to expand ourbusiness and purchased more raw materials; and (iii) a significant decrease in financial assetsat fair value through profit or loss which was caused by our redemption of such financial assetsfor cash to be used in our operations.SUMMARY

Notes:
(1) Return on equity is calculated as profit/(loss) for the year/period divided by the closing balance of total equity
as at the respective reporting dates.
(2) Return on total assets is calculated as profit/(loss) for the year/period divided by the closing balance of total
assets as at the respective reporting dates.
(3) Current ratio is calculated as current assets divided by current liabilities as at the respective reporting dates.(4) Quick ratio is calculated as current assets minus inventories, then divided by current liabilities as at the
respective reporting dates.
(5) Gearing ratio is calculated as total interest-bearing bank borrowings plus lease liabilities, divided by total
equity at the respective reporting dates. Our gearing ratio increased from 76.1% for 2020 to 194.8% for 2021,which was mainly due to (i) an increase in our total interest-bearing bank borrowing plus lease liabilities by47.6% from RMB5,452.1 million as at 31 December 2020 to RMB8,049.2 million as at 31 December 2021,which was due to the fact that we were in expansion of the business scale with increasing lease liabilities fromfarm leasing and increasing bank borrowings to fund the farms building; and (ii) a decrease in total equity by42.3% from RMB7,159.7 million as at 31 December 2020 to RMB4,132.7 million as at 31 December 2021 asa result of a decrease in retained earnings in 2021.SUMMARY
–1 4–“THIS DOCUMENT IS IN DRAFT FORM, INCOMPLETE AND SUBJECT TO CHANGE AND THAT THE INFORMATION MUST

BIOLOGICAL ASSETS AND VALUATION
The fair value of our biological assets decreased by 28.1% from RMB5,681.0 million as

This lineitem represents the changes in fair value of biological assets due to the changes in the stockvolume, physical attributes, market-determined price and replacement cost of the biologicalassets in our two segments of pigs and poultry. We measure our biological assets at their fairvalue less costs to sell. The fair value is measured by reference to local market selling prices.Gains or losses arising from initial recognition of biological assets at fair value less costs tosell and from changes in fair value of biological assets less costs to sell are included in profitor loss in the period in which they arise. During the Track Record Period, our biological assetswere revalued at each reporting date by the Valuer.

The outbreak of COVID-19 has impacted our business in many aspects including the
following:
 Impact on supply chain . As affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, certain parts of
China adopted relevant pandemic prevention measures, which resulted in delays ofresuming feed production in our feed plants and by our feed suppliers. Also, certainof the family farms experienced a temporary shortage of feed as the suppliers wereunable to deliver in time. Government authorities subsequently issued policiesrequiring that, during the prevention and control of the COVID-19 pandemic, thesupply of meat and other necessities shall be ensured, and the transportation ofagricultural raw materials including livestock, poultry and feeds shall not beintercepted.
 Impact on sales . Despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including (i)
certain local governments suspending live poultry markets as part of the pandemicprevention measures, (ii) the suspension of transportation of live pigs and closure ofcertain slaughterhouses, and (iii) social distancing and travel and traffic restrictions,consumption of pork and chicken remained relatively stable during the Track RecordPeriod and up to the Latest Practicable Date.
 Other impacts . Due to the restrictions on the logistics in certain abovementioned
regions, our inventory of frozen chicken increased.
With the gradual resumption of normal economic and business activities in the PRC since
2020 and the further relaxation of the preventive measures since December 2022, and based onour financial performance during the Track Record Period, as at the Latest Practicable Date,our Directors confirmed that the COVID-19 outbreak will not have any material adverse impacton our business operation and financial performance, mainly due to the facts that (i) pork andchicken are the most important protein sources for Chinese people, and the per capitaconsumption thereof remained stable during the COVID-19 outbreak; (ii) governmentauthorities have implemented policies and measures to ensure the stable supply of pork andother necessities during the COVID-19 outbreak, as well as uninterrupted transportation ofagricultural production materials (including livestock, poultry and feeds) across regions; and(iii) we have established a system for prevention and control of the COVID-19 pandemic andadopted strict biosecurity measures for our farms and employees.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND MATERIAL ADVERSE CHANGE
We currently forecast our net profit will decrease in 2023 as compared with that in 2022,
primarily as a result of the decrease in average selling price of market hogs.
Update on Yibin Project and Meishan Project
As at the Latest Practicable Date, we had a food processing plant project in progress in
Yibin City, Sichuan Province, of which the slaughterhouse is expected to be completed in thethird quarter of 2023 with a target annual slaughtering capacity of over three million heads ofpigs. The expected time of commencing production was postponed from the second quarter asoriginally planned to the third quarter of 2023, mainly due to an enhancement to the originaldesign to enable automated pre-cooling, which led to prolonged delivery of equipment andconstruction. We have also established a joint venture with Tönnies (one of the largestintegrated meat product enterprise in Germany) and are constructing a slaughterhouse inMeishan City, Sichuan Province with a target initial annual slaughtering capacity of over twomillion heads of pigs. Subsequent to the Track Record Period and up to the date of thisdocument, we had purchased equipment and were in the process of constructing factoryfacilities for our Yibin Project and Meishan Project.
