We recorded loss from operations of RMB142.5 million, RMB237.5 million and RMB322.8
million in 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively. The increase in loss from operations from 2020 to2022 was primarily due to the following factors:
 the COVID-19 pandemic; and our store- and headquarters-level investments to expand our nationwide store network.See “Financial Information — Our Loss from Operations.”
Loss/Profit for the Year/Period
Our loss for the year was RMB2,017.2 million and RMB5,681.4 million in 2020 and 2021,
respectively, while we had profit for the year of RMB61.9 million in 2022. The increase in our lossfor the year from 2020 to 2021 was primarily attributable to (i) the increase in loss from operationsand (ii) the fair value loss of RMB5,356.8 million of financial liabilities measured at FVTPL in2021 compared to the fair value loss of RMB1,842.5 million in 2020, which primarily reflectedchanges in our valuation. We had profit for the year in 2022 primarily because of the fair value gainof RMB489.2 million of financial liabilities measured at FVTPL in 2022. See “FinancialInformation — Description of Select Combined Statements of Comprehensive Income Line Items— Fair Value Changes of Financial Liabilities Measured at FVTPL.”
Our profit for the period increased from RMB59.6 million in the three months ended

During the Track Record Period, our non-current liabilities primarily comprised financial
liabilities measured at FVTPL related to [ REDACTED ] Investments, including redemption
liabilities and convertible redeemable preferred shares. As of December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022and March 31, 2023, our financial liabilities measured at FVTPL represented 68.2%, 80.4%, 77.2%and 78.5% of our total liabilities, respectively.

Track Record Period, in line with the changes in our valuation. The non-cash fair value loss offinancial liabilities measured at FVTPL in 2020 and 2021 had an adverse impact on ourconsolidated statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. Our net loss in 2020 and2021 further affected our consolidated statements of changes in equity. Together with the impact of(i) our acquisition of non-controlling interests of certain non-wholly owned subsidiaries in 2022 andearly 2023; and (ii) our total deficit as of January 1, 2020, we had net liabilities during the TrackRecord Period. Our net liabilities increased significantly from RMB2.7 billion as of December 31,2020 to RMB8.2 billion as of December 31, 2021, mainly because the increase in our valuationresulted in the significant fair value loss of redemption liabilities and convertible redeemablepreferred shares related to [ REDACTED ] Investments. Our net liabilities increased from RMB8.2
billion as of December 31, 2021 to RMB8.4 billion as of December 31, 2022, mainly because weacquired the non-controlling interests of certain non-wholly owned subsidiaries. See “Business —Store Network Optimization Initiatives” for more information about our acquisition of non-controlling interests. Our net liabilities decreased from RMB8.4 billion as of December 31, 2022to RMB8.3 billion as of March 31, 2023, mainly because we had net profit of RMB77.7 million forthe three months ended March 31, 2023.
Our net current assets increased from RMB254.6 million as of December 31, 2020 to RMB1.5
billion as of December 31, 2021, primarily due to the increases in trade and other receivables,inventories, and cash and cash equivalents. Our net current assets dropped to RMB489.7 million asof December 31, 2022 mainly due to the decreases in our inventories and other investments. Ournet current assets increased from RMB489.7 million as of December 31, 2022 to RMB609.8 millionas of March 31, 2023, primarily due to the increase in cash and cash equivalents.
Our non-current assets increased from RMB1.9 billion as of December 31, 2020 to RMB3.5
billion as of December 31, 2022, primarily attributable to the increases in right-of-use assets suchas leases and property, plant and equipment during the respective periods. Our non-current assetsdecreased from RMB3.5 billion as of December 31, 2022 to RMB3.3 billion as of March 31, 2023,primarily due to the decrease in right-of-use assets.
Our non-current liabilities increased from RMB4.9 billion as of December 31, 2020 to
RMB12.5 billion as of December 31, 2021, primarily attributable to the increase in our financialliabilities measured at FVTPL. Our non-current liabilities decreased to RMB12.3 billion as ofDecember 31, 2022, and RMB12.2 billion as of March 31, 2023.

Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Our Business
An outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus named COVID-19 that began since the end of
December 2019 has materially and adversely affected the global economy. In response to thepandemic, countries and regions across the world, including China, began to impose movementrestriction measures to contain the spread of the virus. Because of the adverse effects of theCOVID-19 pandemic, we experienced a reduction to a certain degree in sales levels compared tothe same periods in 2019.
In 2020, approximately 28.9% of our retail stores as of December 31, 2020 in 77 cities in
China had temporary store closure for 26.2 days on average. Approximately 71% of our stores inChina were closed for seven or more days in February 2020 when the COVID-19 broke out inChina. For our stores that remained open, the average monthly sales per store declined followingthe shortened hours of operation and reduced customer traffic.
In addition, due to new waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular its Delta and, most
recently, the Omicron variant, from time to time in certain regions across China since 2021, weobserved temporary drop in sales for stores in those regions, primarily as a result of pandemiccontrol measures implemented there. In particular, approximately 12.5% of our retail stores as ofDecember 31, 2021 in 44 cities in China experienced temporary closure for 17.6 days on averagein 2021.
The pandemic situation in China in 2022 was severe due to clusters emerging in multiple
regions simultaneously, including but not limited to, Xi’an in January and April 2022, Shenzhen inMarch 2022, Jilin in March and April 2022, Shanghai from late March to early June 2022, Beijingin May and November 2022, Hainan in August 2022, Chengdu in September 2022, Hohhot, thecapital of Inner Mongolia, in October and November 2022, as well as Guangzhou and Chongqingin November 2022. The pandemic control measures in these regions temporarily and adverselyimpacted our operations and logistics as approximately 83.3% of our retail stores as of December31, 2022 located in 163 different cities in China were temporarily closed for 27.7 days in 2022.SUMMARY
–1 9–THIS DOCUMENT IS IN DRAFT FORM, INCOMPLETE AND SUBJECT TO CHANGE AND THAT THE INFORMATION MUST
BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE SECTION HEADED “WARNING” ON THE COVER OF THIS DOCUMENT.In particular, our operations in Shenzhen were temporarily interrupted due to the outbreak of
the Omicron variant in early March 2022, and resumed normal since April 2022. As a wave ofinfections caused by the Omicron variants emerged in Shanghai since late March 2022, substantiallyall of our stores and our national distribution center in Shanghai were temporarily closed for morethan two months from late March 2022 to early June 2022. At the same time, a large majority ofour stores in Beijing were temporarily closed in May and November 2022. Our average monthlyGMV per store at overall group level decreased from 2021 to 2022 primarily due to decrease inaverage monthly number of transactions per store from 2021 to 2022 since a larger portion of retailstores were temporarily closed for more days on average in China in 2022 compared to 2021.
Due to such pandemic control measures, the logistics in many cities were adversely affected
or even disrupted which affected our procurement and delivery, and increased our associated costs.
Since December 2022, the restrictive measures had been gradually eased. On January 2, 2023,
