OVERVIEW
We are a biopharmaceutical company committed to the discovery, development and
commercialization of first-in-class/best-in-class biologics that regulate immunemicroenvironment by directly modulating both the innate and adaptive immune systems.Leveraging our deep understanding of immunology, we have developed various types ofimmunotherapies including immunocytokines to treat cancers and autoimmune diseases. Westand out as one of the world’s leading companies in developing immunocytokine products, andare among the few early movers with the most clinically advanced immunocytokine candidates,according to Frost & Sullivan. We aim to develop innovative therapies that overcomedisadvantages of currently available treatments, including low response rates and drugresistance, and to bring perceivable benefits and affordable medicine to patients worldwide.
Since our inception in 2018, we have built fully-integrated, end-to-end, in-house R&D
capabilities encompassing all the key biological drug development functionalities, includingdiscovery, antibody and protein engineering, process development, preclinical pharmacologystudies, clinical development, and good manufacturing practice (“ GMP ”)-compliant
manufacturing. Through our proprietary technology platforms, we have identified anddeveloped a pipeline of nine products, with six of them in clinical stage, among which threeare identified as Core Products, i.e. IAP0971, IAE0972 and IAH0968. As a leading companyin exploring antibody-cytokine fusion protein based drugs, we implement a global strategy forour immunocytokine products, and have obtained investigational new drug (“ IND”) approvals
for conducting clinical trials of all three immunocytokines, namely IAP0971, IAE0972 andIBB0979, from regulatory authorities of both China and the U.S. According to Frost &Sullivan, as of the Latest Practicable Date, these three candidates were among the mostclinically advanced immunocytokines in treating cancer patients in the world.
THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL ULTIMATELY BE ABLE TO
DEVELOP AND MARKET OUR CORE PRODUCTS OR ANY OF OUR PIPELINEPRODUCTS SUCCESSFULLY.SUMMARY
–1–THIS DOCUMENT IS IN DRAFT FORM, INCOMPLETE AND SUBJECT TO CHANGE AND THAT THE INFORMATION MUST
BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE SECTION HEADED “WARNING” ON THE COVER OF THIS DOCUMENTOur featured products, immunocytokines, are designed through our proprietary and
internally developed Armed ImmunoCytokine Platform (“ AICTMPlatform ”), leveraging
significant knowledge and experience of our core R&D team in researching antibody-cytokinefusion proteins. They function through diverse mechanisms of action yet share a similarstructure comprising an antibody or quasi-antibody moiety that targets tumors and blockssignaling pathways regulating tumor growth and proliferation, and cytokine payloads thatactivate the immune system within the tumor microenvironment (“ TME ”). Such design is
expected to overcome drawbacks of conventional cytokine-based drugs, such as shorthalf-lives, systemic cytotoxicity and modest efficacies due to cytokine pleiotropy andoff-target effects. It is expected to achieve enhanced antitumor effects through the synergybetween the antibody and cytokine payloads, which will potentially address unmet needs ofcancer patients who suffer from disease progression related to the immunosuppressive TMEand drug resistance.
We have received IND approvals for conducting Phase I/II clinical trials for our Core
Products IAP0971 and IAE0972 in patients with advanced solid tumors from both the NMPAand the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“ FDA ”), and completed the Phase I clinical trials
in July 2023. Phase I clinical data showed that our core immunocytokine products IAP0971 andIAE0972 were well tolerated and demonstrated encouraging preliminary anti-tumor activitiesas monotherapy in heavily pretreated patients who have failed chemotherapy, targeted therapy,immunotherapy, and/or their combination.
In addition to immunocytokines, our R&D capabilities also cover development of
candidates in forms of monoclonal antibodies (“ mAbs ”), bispecific antibodies (“ bsAbs ”), and
fusion proteins, some of which extend indications into treatment areas beyond oncology. OurCore Product IAH0968 is an antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (“ ADCC ”)
enhanced mAb targeting human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (“ HER2 ”) with 100%
fucose knock out, which greatly enhances the binding affinity of its fragment crystallizable(“Fc”) to its receptor Fc /H9253RIIIa. Data from preclinical study showed that IAH0968 increased the
binding affinity up to 20-fold comparing to trastuzumab or Herceptin, an anti-HER2 antibodywithout enhanced ADCC activity. The Phase I clinical data demonstrated a 40% objectiveresponse rate (“ ORR ”), and an 80% disease control rate (“ DCR ”) using IAH0968 as
monotherapy for heavily pretreated metastatic biliary tract carcinoma (“ BTC ”), and colorectal
cancer (“ CRC ”) patients who had failed all previous therapies. Currently, we are conducting
Phase II clinical trials in patients with inoperable HER2+ advanced or metastatic BTC andHER2+ metastatic CRC as first-line treatments.SUMMARY

candidates: clinical stage products IBB0979, IBC0966 and IBD0333, and preclinical stageproducts IAN0982, ISH0988 and ISH0613.
 IBB0979, another immunocytokine developed by us based on AIC
TMPlatform,
received IND approvals from both the FDA and the NMPA for conducting clinicaltrials for B7H3-high expressing solid tumors. It is a potential first-in-class, anti-B7homolog 3 protein (“ B7H3 ”) antibody-IL-10 homodimer bifunctional fusion protein
for immune cell activation. It is designed to bind to B7H3 and trigger blockage ofdownstream signaling pathways that participate in TME shaping and development,and deliver IL-10 to activate CD8+ T cells in the TME.
 IBC0966 is a clinical stage anti-PD-L1 antibody-signal regulatory protein /H9251
(“SIRP /H9251”) bifunctional fusion protein. It is a potential first-in-class PD-L1/SIRP /H9251
dual-target therapy that stimulates both innate and adaptive immunity, leading tostrong synergistic effects and long-lasting tumor-specific immune responses.
 IBD0333 also received IND approvals from both the FDA and the NMPA. It is a
4-1BB/CD24 bsAb, which simultaneously targets CD24 over expressed tumor cellsand activates the stimulatory signal of 4-1BB in CD8+ T cells to induce T cellmediated antitumor immunity at the targeted tumor tissue.
 The remaining candidates, namely IAN0982, ISH0988 and ISH0613, are currently
in the IND enabling stage. IAN0982 is being developed for oncology, whileISH0988 and ISH0613 are immunosuppressors focused on autoimmune diseases.

Core Product IAP0971 – Potential First-in-Class, Anti-PD-1 Antibody-IL-15/IL-15R /H9251
Heterodimer Fusion Protein
Our Core Product IAP0971 is an internally developed, potential first-in-class,
anti-programmed death -1 (“ PD-1 ”) antibody-IL-15/IL-15R /H9251heterodimer dual T cell and
natural killer (“ NK”) cell agonist. IAP0971 is expected to synergistically strengthen the
antitumor activity through blockade of the PD-1/its ligand (“ PD-L1 ”) signaling pathway and
accumulating IL-15 at the targeted tumor site to activate its nearby immune cells, includingCD8+ T cells and NK cells, directly activating both innate and adaptive immune systems. Formore details on the mechanism of action of IAP0971, see “Business — Drug Candidates —Core Product: IAP0971 (PD-1/IL-15 antibody-cytokine fusion protein) — Mechanism ofAction” in this document.
The selection of IL-15 payload and PD-1 target was based on favorable individual
features and the potential for great cis-synergy when combined. IL-15 is deemed a promisingcandidate for developing immunotherapy that could cure cancers. It can promote activation andproliferation of CD8+ T cells and NK cells, and in the meantime it does not induce regulatoryT cell (“ Treg ”)-related immune response suppression that is often observed for IL-2 based
cytokine drugs. Also, IL-15 inhibits IL-2-induced T cell death. As such, IL-15 can stimulateCD8+ cells and NK cells for a longer term and induce more rapid and robust immune responseswithout activating Tregs or inducing apoptosis of activated T cells, which are common sideeffects of IL-2-based therapies.
The selection of the anti-PD-1 antibody was based on several factors, including its ability
to act in the same location on the T cells and NK cells as IL-15, as well as the significantlyhigher expression of PD-1 on CD8+ T cells in the TME compared to peripheral blood andperipheral lymphoid organs. Therefore, the combination of IL-15 and anti-PD-1 antibody canshow cis-synergy with lower systemic cytotoxicity. Furthermore, considering the balancedactivity and dose between the PD-1 antibody and the IL-15 cytokine, IAP0971 is designed toadopt the structure of an intact bivalent anti-PD-1 antibody in combination with a monovalentIL-15. As such, the combination can deliver targeted and controlled amount of IL-15 directlyinto the TME, which effectively recruits, activates and reinvigorates immune cells, leading toa significantly enhanced anti-tumor immunity.
Structure of IAP0971 is also optimized to improve biological activities, developability
and productivities. The cytokine moiety of IAP0971 is designed to adopt a structure of IL-15combining with its receptor IL-15R /H9251to form a heterodimer that resembles its natural state. On
the one hand, the natural high affinity between IL-15 and IL-15R /H9251avoids the formation of
IL-15 homodimer and half antibody fragment, and reduces the mismatch of two different heavychains of the anti-PD-1 antibody, which improves the productivity of IAP0971. On the otherhand, the IL-15/IL-15R /H9251complex adopted in IAP0971 is reported to be more active than IL-15
alone in stimulating proliferation and survival of memory phenotype CD8+ T cells. In addition,the spatial structure of IAP0971 is also optimized by embedding the IL-15/IL-15R /H9251
heterodimer in the “hinge” region of the anti-PD-1 antibody. This structure can balance thedose of IL-15 cytokine with that of the PD-1 antibody, as well as prevent degradation of IL-15,thereby prolonging the half-life of IL-15. For more details on the competitive advantages ofIAP0971, see “Business — Drug Candidates — Core Product: IAP0971 (PD-1/IL-15antibody-cytokine fusion protein) — Competitive Advantages” in this document.SUMMARY
–6–THIS DOCUMENT IS IN DRAFT FORM, INCOMPLETE AND SUBJECT TO CHANGE AND THAT THE INFORMATION MUST
BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE SECTION HEADED “WARNING” ON THE COVER OF THIS DOCUMENTPreclinical data showed that IAP0971 was well tolerated up to 1.0 mg/kg when
subcutaneously administered in MC38 syngeneic mouse model. In the repeated-dose toxicitystudy in cynomolgus monkeys, IAP0971 showed a favorable safety profile even at 1.2 mg/kg,around 40-fold higher than an IL-15-Fc fusion protein. Furthermore, in pharmacokineticanalysis, IAP0971 showed a half-life of 15.7 hours, which is approximately 15-fold longer thanthat of recombinant IL-15, and approximately 2-fold longer than that of an IL-15-Fc fusionprotein. In addition, IAP0971 achieved superior tumor inhibition rate (110.47% when treatedwith 0.5mg/kg of IAP0971 vs. 74% when treated with 0.5mg/kg of anti-PD-1 antibody) andcomplete tumor regression rate (90% when treated with 0.5mg/kg of IAP0971 vs. 50% whentreated with 0.5mg/kg of anti-PD-1 antibody) in our preclinical study.
According to Frost & Sullivan, currently, there is no IL-15-based immunotherapy
indicated for the treatment of cancer approved for marketing worldwide. Outside of China,there are eleven products under clinical development. Among these products, IAP0971 and theother six product candidates are IL-15 based immunocytokines. Being in the clinical stage ofPhase I/II, IAP0971 is one of the most clinically advanced immunocytokines in the world. InChina, there are five products currently under clinical development, with the most clinicallyadvanced products in Phase I/II stage. Only two products including IAP0971 are IL-15 basedimmunocytokines, and IAP0971 is the most clinically advanced immunocytokine in China.
In July 2023, we completed Phase I clinical trial of IAP0971 for advanced malignant
tumors. Phase I clinical data showed that IAP0971 exhibited a favorable safety profile at up to200µg/kg in patients with advanced malignant tumors, with no dose-limiting toxicity (“ DLT ”)
and maximum tolerable dose (“ MTD ”) observed. Preliminary anti-tumor efficacy was
observed in four patients treated with IAP0971 as a later-line therapy. These four patientsinclude one with CRC, one with cervical cancer, and two with non-small cell lung cancer(“NSCLC ”), and those patients underwent multiple rounds of treatments including
chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy and/or their combination, and experienceddisease progress and metastases. After receiving IAP0971 for two treatment cycles, all fourpatients achieved stable disease (“ SD”). Especially, one NSCLC patient complicated with
adrenal gland and other metastases was resistant to several prior treatments, includingchemotherapy regimes such as multiple paclitaxel-containing combination, and combinationtherapies with targeted therapy and immunotherapy, such as erlotinib, camrelizumab,sintilizumab and bevacizumab. This patient received 120µg/kg IAP0971 for two treatmentcycles and achieved SD. The other NSCLC patient complicated with pleura or pleural effusionmetastases was resistant to several prior treatments, and also achieved SD after two cycles of200µg/kg IAP0971 administration.
In January 2022 and December 2021, we obtained IND clearance from both the NMPA
and the FDA for conducting Phase I/II clinical trials in patients with advanced malignanttumors, respectively. In July 2023, we completed the Phase I clinical trial. As of the LatestPracticable Date, we have not received any concerns or objections from the NMPA related tothe commencement of a Phase II clinical trial. We plan to initiate a Phase II clinical trial forIAP0971 in China in the fourth quarter of 2023. For more details on the clinical developmentplan of IAP0971, see “Business — Drug Candidates — Core Product: IAP0971 (PD-1/IL-15antibodycytokine fusion protein) — Clinical Development Plan” in this document.SUMMARY

BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE SECTION HEADED “WARNING” ON THE COVER OF THIS DOCUMENTCore Product IAE0972 – Potential First-in-Class, Anti-EGFR Antibody-IL-10
Homodimer Bifunctional Fusion Protein
Our Core Product IAE0972 is an internally developed, potential first-in-class, anti-EGFR
antibody-IL-10 homodimer bifunctional fusion protein for immune cell activation. LikeIAP0971, IAE0972 is also expected to achieve synergistical antitumor activities leveraging theadvantages of immunocytokine yet through a different combination of antibody target andcytokine payload. It is designed to blockade the EGFR signaling pathway and specificallydeliver IL-10 to the targeted tumor site to activate CD8+ T cells, and potentially NK cells. Formore details on the mechanism of action of IAE0972, see “Business — Drug Candidates —Core Product: IAE0972 (EGFR/IL-10 antibody-cytokine fusion protein) — Mechanism ofAction” in this document.
The development of IAE0972 aimed to address the issue of immune cell exhaustion
observed in current PD-1/PD-L1-based immunotherapies and overcome the limitations ofcurrent EGFR-based mAbs. IL-10 is a potent activator of tumor-infiltrating memory cytotoxicantigen-specific CD8+ T cells in the TME and can restore the tumor-killing activity oftumor-infiltrating terminally exhausted T cells. Because the anti-EGFR antibody fragment canspecifically enrich IL-10 in the TME, IAE0972 can effectively and specifically activate theimmune system by reinvigorating antigen specific CD8+ T cells and facilitating itsproliferation, and inhibiting tumor growth by blocking the EGFR signaling pathway to killEGFR-positive tumor cells. As a result, it is expected to resolve the issues of low ORR anddrug resistance commonly observed with anti-EGFR antibodies.
Like IAP0971, IAE0972 also adopts the natural structure of IL-10 that is in a homodimer
form, so that the natural pairing between IL-10 molecules will improve the developability andproductivity of IAE0972. But unlike IAP0971, IAE0972 adopts an asymmetric structure, whichconsists of a monovalent anti-EGFR antibody fragment and a homodimer of IL-10. Such designis expected to reduce the binding activity of anti-EGFR antibody on EGFR-low expressionnormal cells while preserving the biological activity on EGFR-high expression tumor cells andthus reduce EGFR-related skin toxicities. In addition, spatial structure of IAE0972 alsoemploys the knobs-into-holes format in the Fc to promote asymmetric formation and improveits developability. This optimization extends the half-life of IL-10 and improves its therapeuticefficacy. For more details on the competitive advantages of IAE0972, see “Business — DrugCandidates — Core Product: IAE0972 (EGFR/IL-10 antibody-cytokine fusion protein) —Competitive Advantages” in this document.
In vivo data of the preclinical study showed that IAE0972 was well tolerated up to 6
mg/kg in cynomolgus monkeys, which is 300 times the safe dosage of IL-10 cytokine therapy.Also, no obvious EGFR-related skin toxicity, no significant organ changes for liver, thymus,adrenal gland and thyroid gland, as well as no significant changes for levels of IL-2, tumornecrosis factor-alpha (“ TNF/H9251”) and Interferon-gamma (“ IFN/H9253”) were observed in the
cynomolgus monkey repeated-dose toxicity studies. Studies showed that IAE0972 had a tumorgrowth inhibition (“ TGI”) rate of 83% in a MC38-hEGFR syngeneic mice model, which rate
is significantly higher than that of an anti-EGFR antibody.SUMMARY

cell carcinoma, rectal cancer, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, SCLC or NSCLC whoprogressed from at least one line of treatment. We completed dose escalation for 1 µg/kg, 10µg/kg, 100 µg/kg, 0.3mg/kg, 1.0mg/kg and 2.5mg/kg of IAE0972, and only observed one Grade3 adverse events. Preliminary efficacy was observed in multiple heavily pretreated patientswho failed all previous therapies. A CRC patient complicated by lung metastasis, who hasreceived multiple lines of prior treatments including standard mFOLFOX6 (5-fluorouracil,leucovorin and oxaliplatin) and CapeOX (capecitabine and oxaliplatin) regimens, achieved SDafter given 10µg/kg of IAE0972 for two treatment cycles. Another patient with rectal cancerand lung metastasis and lymph node metastasis, who had experienced recurrence after receivedtwo resections, achieved SD after receiving 1.0mg/kg of IAE0972 monotherapy for two cycles.
Currently, there are no approved IL-10 based immunotherapies indicated for the treatment
of cancer according to Frost & Sullivan. Outside of China, our IAE0972 and IBB0979 are theonly IL-10 based immunocytokines under clinical development for cancer treatment. In China,three IL-10 based immunotherapies are currently under clinical development with two of themfrom us, i.e. IAE0972 and IBB0979. As of the Latest Practicable Date, our IAE0972 andIBB0979 are in Phase I/II clinical stage, which are the most clinically advanced IL-10 basedimmunocytokines in China.
We obtained the approval for conducting Phase I/II clinical trials in patients with
locally-advanced or metastatic solid tumors from the FDA and the NMPA in December 2021and January 2022, respectively, and completed the Phase I clinical trial in July 2023. As of theLatest Practicable Date, we have not received any concerns or objections from the NMPArelated to the commencement of Phase II clinical trials for IAE0972, and expect to initiate thePhase II clinical trial in the fourth quarter of 2023 in China.

Core Product IAH0968 – Potential Best-in-Class, ADCC Enhanced Anti-HER2 mAb
Our Core Product IAH0968 is an internally developed, the first anti-HER2 antibody in
clinical stage with 100% fucose-removal. Antibodies consist of two structural regions, antigenbinding fragment (“ Fab”) and Fc. Unlike Fab region, which defines the specific target of an
antibody, Fc region mediates ADCC by activating the immune system through engagingvarious Fc receptors. Studies of the structure of the Fc region of antibodies and its receptorFc/H9253RIIIa complex revealed that the core fucose of the Fc region is accommodated at a place
that interferes with the binding between the Fc region and Fc /H9253RIIIa, and thus reducing the
affinity between them and resulting in lower ADCC activity. Therefore, modifying to removefucose is desirable to better recruit immune cells, resulting in enhanced ADCC activity. As aresult, this approach has been widely attempted in the biopharmaceutical industry. However,despite numerous attempts by multiple players to modify antibodies through variousapproaches, such as Fc point specific mutation and fucose removal, most resulting antibodiesstill contain a certain percentage of core fucose. For more details on the mechanism of actionof IAH0968, see “Business — Drug Candidates — Core Product: IAH0968 (ADCC enhancedanti-HER2 mAb) — Mechanism of Action” in this document.SUMMARY
–9–THIS DOCUMENT IS IN DRAFT FORM, INCOMPLETE AND SUBJECT TO CHANGE AND THAT THE INFORMATION MUST
BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE SECTION HEADED “WARNING” ON THE COVER OF THIS DOCUMENTWe addressed this technical difficulty through constructing a new cell line with mutated
FUT8 gene, which encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of fucose residue from itsdonor to its target. After genetic manipulation, the new cell line is not able to attach fucose toany protein it produced. In such way, we have successfully generated potentially the firstanti-HER2 antibody with 100% removal of fucose from its Fc region, i.e. IAH0968. Suchachievement has been verified through glycoprotein detection and glycosylation quantification.For more details on the competitive advantages of IAH0968, see “Business — Drug Candidates— Core Product: IAH0968 (ADCC enhanced anti-HER2 mAb) — Competitive Advantages” inthis document.
Produced through our AEA
TMPlatform, IAH0968 showed an affinity between IAH0968
and its Fc receptor five to 20 times higher than unmodified or other ADCC enhancedanti-HER2 antibodies in preclinical studies (especially for the Fc /H9253RIIIa, 158F polymorphism).
In vitro assays demonstrated that IAH0968 mediated stronger ADCC killing toxicity against
HER2+ tumor cells SKBR3, BT474 and SKOV2 than trastuzumab. Moreover, IAH0968showed 100% TGI in a BT474 tumor cell subcutaneous murine model, superior to trastuzumab.In cynomolgus monkeys, IAH0968 showed an excellent safety profile, with no observedadverse effect at a dosage over 100mg/kg.
The Phase I clinical trial showed that IAH0968 was well tolerated and exhibited antitumor
activities in patients with advanced HER2+ malignant solid tumors including breast cancers,gastric cancers, CRC and BTC with drug resistance to trastuzumab, pertuzumab, cetuximab,docetaxel, oxaliplatin, capecitabine, irinotecan, nab-paclitaxel and apatinib, or PD1 mAbs.Data showed that only one DLT was found at dosage 10mg/kg, and no MTD was reached.While no head-to-head study was conducted, the Phase I clinical data showed that IAH0968achieved significantly improved ORR and DCR in heavily pretreated metastatic CRC and BTCpatients, when compared to the historical data of current treatments. For heavily pretreatedmetastatic CRC and BTC patients, the ORR was 40%, and DCR was 80%.
According to Frost & Sullivan, there are three anti-HER2 mAbs in clinical development
for cancer treatment outside of China. Among them, the most advanced product is in PhaseII/III clinical trial. In China, there are four products in clinical development, with the mostadvanced ones also in Phase II/III stage. IAH0968 stands out as the most clinically advancedADCC-enhanced anti-HER2 mAb in China and rest of the world, which is currently in PhaseII/III clinical stage.
Based on the encouraging clinical data from the Phase I trial, we obtained IND clearance
from the NMPA to proceed with Phase II/III clinical trials of using IAH0968 in combinationwith chemotherapy for first-line treatment of inoperable HER2+ advanced or metastatic CRCand HER2+ metastatic BTC patients in September 2022. We have dosed the first CRC patientof the Phase II trial in May 2023, and expect to dose the first patient of the Phase II clinicaltrial for BTC in the third quarter of 2023. For more details on the clinical development planof IAH0968, see “Business — Drug Candidates — Core Product: IAH0968 (ADCC enhancedanti-HER2 mAb) — Clinical Development Plan” in this document.SUMMARY

Fusion Protein
IBB0979, another immunocytokine developed by us, is a clinical stage, potential
first-in-class, anti-B7H3 antibody-IL-10 homodimer bifunctional fusion protein for immunecell activation. It is designed to bind to B7H3 and trigger blockage of downstream signalingpathways that participate in TME shaping and development, and deliver IL-10 to activateCD8+ T cells to fight against tumors. Preclinical study showed that IBB0979 has high affinityto both targets and exhibited potent TGI in C57BL/6J mice bearing MC38-hB7H3 cell line,with TGI of 100% at 0.3mg/kg, 1mg/kg and 3mg/kg respectively. An in vivo study in
cynomolgus monkeys showed that after intravenously administered with 1 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg and6 mg/kg of IBB0979 once a week for 29 days (5 times in total, given in days 1, 8, 15, 22 and29), MTD was not reached up to 6 mg/kg. There was no administration-related mortality, andno donor-related changes observed.
According to Frost & Sullivan, there are currently no approved B7H3-targeted
immunotherapies indicated for the treatment of cancer. Outside of China, there are twelveproducts in various stages of clinical development, with the most advanced candidatesundergoing Phase II clinical trials. In China, six products targeting B7H3 are currently underclinical development, with the most advanced product in Phase II. Globally, among all productcandidates targeting B7H3, the Company’s product IBB0979 stands out as the onlyimmunocytokine currently undergoing investigation in clinical trials.
We obtained the approval for conducting Phase I/II clinical trials in patients with
locally-advanced or metastatic solid tumors from the FDA and the NMPA in October 2022 andNovember 2022, respectively. The Phase I/II clinical trial is currently on-going, with the firstpatient dosed in July 2023. Since B7H3 is overexpressed in a wide range of cancers includingglioma, thyroid, lung, head and neck, rectal, prostate, breast, skin, renal cell, and ovariancancers, it has the potential to become a next-generation therapy for resolving T cell exhaustionin cancer patients.

BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE SECTION HEADED “WARNING” ON THE COVER OF THIS DOCUMENTOUR PLATFORMS
AICTMPlatform
Our AICTMPlatform is a frontrunner in the field of immunocytokine development from
multiple aspects, including cytokine selection and optimization, antibody selection andengineering, structural design and engineering, and production through customized cell line. Itis a powerful research engine that includes not only a pool of intact immunoglobulin G (“ IgG”)
antibodies and cytokines, but also functional antibody fragments and other types of immunesystem modulators. It is able to generate products ranging from immunocytokines to otherbifunctional fusion proteins. Our clinical stage drug candidates IAP0971, IAE0972 andIBB0979, and preclinical stage drug candidates ISH0988 and ISH0613 were developed basedon the AIC
TMPlatform.
Our AICTMPlatform successfully addresses technical difficulties for developing
immunocytokines. These difficulties range from antibody and cytokine selection andoptimization, to final drug production.
 Antibody/cytokine selection. Due to different spatial structure, different types of
cytokines behave largely different when fused with antibodies targeting differentantigens.
 Structural design. Dose ratio and activity between the selected antibody and
cytokine is needed to be balanced to achieve the desired mechanism of actions(“MoA ”) and synergistic effects.
 Manufacturing capabilities. It is challenging for developing and manufacturing
immunocytokine molecules, because they are structurally complicated, especiallyconsidering the degradation vulnerability of cytokines.
Core competencies of our AIC
TMPlatform include MoA-based antibody-cytokine
selection, biology-oriented structural design and protein engineering, and production throughcustomized cell lines.
 MoA-based antibody-cytokine selection is the cornerstone to achieve desired
synergistic effects between antibody and cytokine. For example, selection ofanti-PD1 antibody and IL-15 cytokine for developing IAP0971 is grounded on theirshared action site on the same T/NK cells, leading to great cis-synergy. The
combination of anti-EGFR antibody and IL-10 is selected based on the potentialengager effects it can produce. Specifically, IAE0972 can engage CD8+ T cellsthrough IL-10 while simultaneously targeting tumor cells through the EGFRantibody moiety.SUMMARY
–1 3–THIS DOCUMENT IS IN DRAFT FORM, INCOMPLETE AND SUBJECT TO CHANGE AND THAT THE INFORMATION MUST
BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE SECTION HEADED “WARNING” ON THE COVER OF THIS DOCUMENT Structural design and protein engineering module enables us to structurally design
and modify our products to achieve improved safety and efficacy profile whilereducing manufacturing cost and enhancing product quality manageability.Structural modifications that we are capable to perform through our AIC
TMPlatform
include antibody and cytokine engineering, deglycosylation, linker/spacer designand optimization, and tertiary structure alteration. Especially, developed through theAIC
TMPlatform, IAP0971 employs the natural pairing of IL-15/IL-15R /H9251, which
leads to more efficient dimerization and eliminates the formation of IL-15homodimer and half antibody fragments. Additionally, a knobs-into-holes structureis introduced in the Fc region of the anti-PD-1 antibody, reducing the mismatch oftwo different heavy chains. These structural designs result in improved productivityof IAP0971. Furthermore, IAP0971 is also modified by engineering the IL-15/IL-15R/H9251heterodimers partially embedded into the “hinge” region in the anti-PD-1
antibody. Our drug candidate is the first of this structure to enter into clinical trial,according to Frost & Sullivan. It can increase the stability of cytokine by “hiding”a substantial portion of cytokine within antibody to protect it from hydrolysis byproteases, as well as balance the activity of cytokine versus antibody by introducingsteric hindrance to the cytokine, and in the meantime retain the specificity andaffinity of cytokine to bind to its receptor and allow it to mediate immune responses.
 Production through customized cell lines is another important function performed by
our AIC
TMPlatform. The cell lines we constructed for producing immunocytokines
and other bifunctional fusion proteins are obtained after undergoing multiple roundsof metabolic and growth optimization and are of high expression capacity andexcellent purification yield. Coupled with unique cytokine-specific codonoptimization, stably expressed vehicles with optimized expression cassettes and ourhigh-throughput screening system, it is able to reach an expression level of 3-5g/Land one-step affinity chromatography purity of 90%, which is at the top level amongrivals both at home and abroad, according to Frost & Sullivan.
AEA
TMPlatform
Our AEATMPlatform is a genetically manipulated Chinese hamster ovary (“ CHO ”) cell
line with the FUT8 gene knocked-out from its genome to generate antibodies with enhancedADCC and improved anti-tumor activities. Through this genome modification, the CHO cellline will not be able to catalyze the transfer of fucose residue from its donor to its target, andthus is not able to produce any antibody that carries fucose. Because absence of core fucoseon the Fc region has been shown to increase the Fc region’s binding affinity (up to 100 times)to its receptor Fc /H9253RIIIa present on immune effector cells, fucose-negative antibodies are
expected to have enhanced ADCC activities through better activating immune effector cells.SUMMARY
–1 4–THIS DOCUMENT IS IN DRAFT FORM, INCOMPLETE AND SUBJECT TO CHANGE AND THAT THE INFORMATION MUST
BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE SECTION HEADED “WARNING” ON THE COVER OF THIS DOCUMENTComparing to other platforms that aim to achieve enhanced ADCC by removing fucose
from antibodies, AEATMPlatform is expected to produce antibodies with 0% of fucose, which
rapidly, stably and thoroughly enhances the ADCC of antibodies and simplifies quality controlof the products. Different genetic engineering has been adopted by different platforms.However, platforms seldom achieved 100% fucose removal. To date, our AEA
TMPlatform and
POTELLIGENT from Kyowa Kirin are the only two platforms that can achieve 100% fucoseremoval rate, according to Frost & Sullivan.
Feasibility and advantages of AEA
TMPlatform have been demonstrated by IAH0968, the
potential first complete fucose-removal anti-HER2-antibody in clinical stage developedthrough this platform. We have verified through glycoprotein detection and glycosylationquantification that IAH0968 does not contain any fucose. In addition, in vitro andin vivo tests
showed that the affinity between IAH0968 and its Fc receptor was five to 20 times higher thanunmodified or other ADCC enhanced anti-HER2 antibodies, resulting in greater enhancedADCC activity and anti-tumor efficacy.
AIM
TMPlatform
Our AIMTMPlatform focuses on designing multi-functional biological products by
engaging the innate immune system for cancer immunotherapy. It selects tumor associatedantigen antibodies for cancer targeting, receptors agonist antibodies for innate effectoractivation, and cytokines and other TME factors for immune modulation to design multi-specific antibody fusion proteins, and evaluates them in terms of expression, target binding, in
vitro and in vivo biological activities, as well as druggability. Currently, we have developed
several categories of our proprietary AIM
TMPlatform that allow us to explore the combination
of innate immunity stimulators with different types and numbers of targets, which provide uswith abundant flexibility and diversity of various types of TME modulations for differentclinical indications.
By targeting innate immunity stimulators instead of adaptive immunity stimulators, which
is considered more cytotoxic and easily restrained by immune escape of tumors and theimmunosuppressive TME, products developed from our AIM
TMPlatform are expected to
achieve desired clinical safety and efficacy profiles. Our preclinical product IAN0982 wasdeveloped based on the AIM
TMPlatform.

Our Directors are of the opinion that, taking into account the financial resources available
to our Group, including cash and cash equivalents, the Pre-[ REDACTED ] Investments and the
estimated net [ REDACTED ] from the [ REDACTED ], as well as cash burn rate, we have
available sufficient working capital to cover at least 125% of the Group’s costs, includinggeneral, administrative and operating costs (including any production costs), and research anddevelopment costs, for at least the next 12 months from the date of this document.
Our cash burn rate refers to the average monthly amount of net cash used in operating
activities, capital expenditures, and other scheduled cash payment. Assuming an average cashburn rate going forward of [ REDACTED ] the level in 2022, taking into account the
Pre-[ REDACTED ] Investment and scheduled payment of indebtedness, we estimate that ourSUMMARY

SUMMARY OF MATERIAL RISK FACTORS
We believe that there are certain risks involved in our operations, many of which are
beyond our control. These risks are set out in the section headed “Risk Factors” in thisdocument. Some of the major risks we face include:
 Our business and financial prospects depend substantially on the success of our
clinical stage and preclinical stage drug candidates. In particular, among our productcandidates, IAP0971, IAE0972 and IBB0979 are with first-in-class potential, andIAH0968 is with best-in-class potential. However, if we are unable to successfullycomplete their clinical development, obtain their regulatory approvals and achievetheir commercialization, or if we experience significant delays in doing any of theforegoing, our business will be materially harmed;
 We invest substantial resources in research and development in order to develop,
enhance or adapt to new technologies and methodologies, which may not besuccessful attempts;SUMMARY
–2 3–THIS DOCUMENT IS IN DRAFT FORM, INCOMPLETE AND SUBJECT TO CHANGE AND THAT THE INFORMATION MUST
BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE SECTION HEADED “WARNING” ON THE COVER OF THIS DOCUMENT We face intense competition and our competitors may discover, develop or
commercialize competing drugs faster or more successfully than we do, which mayadversely affect our ability to successfully commercialize our drug candidates;
 If we are unable to obtain and maintain adequate patent and other intellectual
property protection for our drug candidates throughout the selected markets in theworld, or if the scope of such intellectual property rights obtained is not sufficientlybroad, third parties could develop and commercialize drug candidates andtechnologies similar or identical to ours and compete directly against us, and ourability to successfully develop and commercialize any of our drug candidates ortechnologies would be materially and adversely affected;
 We have limited experience in manufacturing therapeutic biologic products on a
large commercial scale, and our business could be materially and adversely affectedif we encounter problems in manufacturing our future drug products;
 If we are unable to build and manage sales network, or maintain sufficient sales and
marketing capabilities, either by ourselves or through third parties, we may not beable to successfully create or increase market awareness of our products or sell ourproducts, which will materially affect our ability to generate product sales revenue;
 We have a limited operating history and have incurred net losses since inception. We
expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future and may not be ableto generate sufficient revenue to achieve or maintain profitability;
 We may need to obtain additional financing to fund our operations even if we
consummate the [ REDACTED ], and if we fail to obtain such financing, we may be
unable to complete the development and commercialization of our primary drugcandidates; and
 There has been no prior [ REDACTED ] market for our Shares and there can be no
assurance that an active market would develop, especially taking into account thatcertain of our existing shareholders may be subject to a lock-up period, and the[REDACTED ] and [ REDACTED ] of our Shares may be volatile.

USE OF [REDACTED ]

the mid-point of the indicative [ REDACTED ] of HK$[ REDACTED ] to HK$[ REDACTED ]
per Share in this document. We currently intend to apply these net [ REDACTED ] for the
following purposes:

research and development of our Core Products, namely IAP0971, IAE0972 andIAH0968;

research and development of our other clinical pipeline product candidates, namelyIBB0979, IBC0966 and IBD0333;

planned clinical trials of our other preclinical pipeline product candidates; and

indicative [ REDACTED ] of HK$[ REDACTED ] to HK$[ REDACTED ] per Share),
representing approximately [ REDACTED ]% of the estimated gross [ REDACTED ] from the

approximately HK$[ REDACTED ], comprising (a) fees and expenses of our legal advisors and
reporting accountants of approximately HK$[ REDACTED ], and (b) other fees and expenses
of approximately HK$[ REDACTED ]. During the Track Record Period, the [ REDACTED ]

unusually high to our Group. The [ REDACTED ] above are the latest practicable estimate for
reference only, and the actual amount may differ from this estimate. Our Directors do notexpect such [ REDACTED ] to have a material adverse impact on our results of operations for
