OVERVIEW
We are a leading automotive-grade computing SoC and SoC-based intelligent vehicle
solution provider. SoC is an integrated circuit that integrates key electronic componentsincluding central processing units, memories, I/O interfaces and others. We started with theHuashan Series high-computing power SoCs for autonomous driving and recently introducedthe Wudang Series cross-domain SoCs to address more diverse and sophisticated demands foradvanced functionalities of intelligent vehicles. Our proprietary automotive-grade products andtechnologies empower intelligent vehicles with mission-critical capabilities, such asautonomous driving, smart cockpit, advanced imaging and interconnection. We offer full-stackautonomous driving capabilities to meet broad customer needs through SoCs and SoC-basedsolutions, powered by our in-house developed IP cores, algorithms and support software. Interms of shipment of automotive-grade high-computing power SoCs in 2022, we are the thirdlargest provider globally, according to Frost & Sullivan.
As autonomous driving systems become increasingly complex, automotive OEMs tend to
strategically adopt and stick with a limited number of technology platforms for vehicle modelsat the same automation level across product lines or brands for efficiency and avoidance ofhigh switching costs, resulting in automotive OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers forming long-termanchored partnerships with selected top-tier autonomous driving SoC providers. Currently,SUMMARY

Notes:
(1) Fair value change in financial instruments issued to investors represents (i) redeemable convertible
preferred shares, (ii) warrants for purchase of ordinary shares, (iii) convertible notes, and (iv)commitment derivatives. Fair value changes in financial instruments issued to investors are not directlyrelated to our ability to generate revenue from our daily operations, and we do not expect to record anyfurther fair value changes in financial instruments issued to investors as (i) preferred shares liabilitieswill be redesignated from liabilities to equity as a result of the automatic conversion into ordinary sharesupon the [ REDACTED ]; (ii) convertible notes are expected to be converted to preferred shares
liabilities before the [ REDACTED ]; (iii) warrant liabilities are expected to be settled before the
[REDACTED ]; and (iv) commitment derivatives are expected to be converted to preferred shares
liabilities before the [ REDACTED ].
(2) Share based payment expenses mainly represent the non-cash employee benefit expenses incurred in
connection with our award to key employees. Such expenses in any specific period are not expected toresult in future cash payments and are not indicative of our core operating results.
(3) A non-IFRS measure.
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, we also use adjusted net loss as
additional financial measure, which is not required by, or presented in accordance with IFRS.We believe this non-IFRS measure facilitates comparisons of operating performance fromperiod to period and company to company by eliminating potential impacts of certain items. Webelieve this measure provides useful information to investors and others in understanding andevaluating our consolidated results of operations in the same manner as they help ourmanagement. However, our presentation of adjusted net loss may not be comparable tosimilarly titled measures presented by other companies. The use of this non-IFRS measure asan analytical tool has limitations, and you should not consider it in isolation from, or as asubstitute for an analysis of, our results of operations or financial condition as reported underIFRS.SUMMARY

RECENT DEVELOPMENT
We announced our Wudang Series cross-domain SoCs in April 2023, the first in the
industry to integrate autonomous driving, smart cockpit, body control and other computationaldomains, according to Frost & Sullivan. In March 2023, we announced cooperation with JICA,an affiliate of ECARX, to install our A1000 SoC on Geely’s vehicles. In April 2023, we weredesignated as Baidu’s preferred domestic intelligent vehicle SoC partner and will jointlydevelop autonomous driving products integrating hardware and software based on HuashanA1000 Series SoCs. As of the Latest Practicable Date, we had earned design wins for massproduction of SoC products for 15 vehicle models with 10 automotive OEMs and Tier 1suppliers, among which we had collaborated with Geely, Dongfeng, HYCAN, FAW Group,Baolong and a wide range of other automotive OEMs for factory-installation of our A1000 SoCon their vehicle models.
Our Directors confirm that there has been no material adverse change in our financial or
