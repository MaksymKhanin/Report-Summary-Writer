OVERVIEW
We are a Singapore-headquartered ribonucleic acid (“ RNA ”) technology company that is
making diagnostic solutions for the early detection of diseases accessible on a global scale. Weare a pioneer and leader in developing and commercializing accurate, non-invasive andaffordable blood-based microRNA (“ miRNA ”) test kits for the early detection of cancer and
other diseases. According to Frost & Sullivan, we are one of the few companies globally thathave obtained regulatory approval for in vitro diagnostic (“ IVD ”) product in the molecular
cancer screening industry*, and we are also the world’s first and only company that hasobtained regulatory approval for IVD products of molecular gastric cancer screening.
With the motto “To Know. To Act” in mind, we aim to become a leading RNA centric
multi-omics technology company that provides accurate, accessible, and actionable diagnosticsolutions to address critical unmet clinical needs across the care continuum, with a focus oncancer early detection, risk stratification of individuals as well as precision medicine. Ourmission is to save lives and reduce socio-economic burden of cancer through development andcommercialization of innovative cancer early detection tests.
Our Company was founded in 2014 by our co-founders, Dr. TOO Heng Phon, Dr. ZHOU
Lihan and Dr. ZOU Ruiyang, who have achieved outstanding academic record with extensiveresearch experience in the field of miRNA-based molecular detection. They pioneered theinvention of miRNA polymerase chain reaction (“ PCR ”) technology with high sensitivity,
specificity and reproducibility and proved the scientific and clinical significance of applyingsuch technologies to the screening and early detection of various diseases. Our co-foundersestablished Singapore’s first PCR laboratory in early 2000 for RNA diagnostics incollaboration with other research institutes. They subsequently established a world leadingmiRNA candidate discovery laboratory in Singapore in 2012, with a daily throughput of 0.2million PCR reactions, which was one of the miRNA candidate discovery laboratories with thehighest throughput in the world at that time, according to Frost & Sullivan.
Under the leadership of our co-founders, we have developed two business segments,
namely (a) Early Detection and Precision Multi-omics segment, under which we offer variousdisease early detection products (including our Core Product GASTROClear
TM) and services,
multi-omics candidate discovery and clinical genomic testing, and (b) Infectious Diseasessegment.

–2–THIS DOCUMENT IS IN DRAFT FORM, INCOMPLETE AND SUBJECT TO CHANGE AND THAT THE INFORMATION MUST
BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE SECTION HEADED “WARNING” ON THE COVER OF THIS DOCUMENT.Our Core Product
GASTROClearTM, our Core Product, is the first and only approved molecular IVD
product for gastric cancer screening globally, according to Frost & Sullivan. GASTROClearTM
is a blood-based miRNA detection panel consisting of 12 miRNA biomarkers for gastric cancerscreening and early detection. GASTROClear
TMhas been successfully commercialized after
obtaining Class C IVD certificate from the HSA in September 2019, and has obtained the CEMark in November 2017. More recently in May 2023, GASTROClear
TMobtained breakthrough
device designation from the FDA, which makes us the first to obtain the breakthrough devicedesignation from the FDA for blood-based miRNA diagnostic test as well as for moleculardiagnostic test for gastric cancer. The FDA’s breakthrough device designation forGASTROClear
TMsignifies its remarkable potential to deliver improved treatment or diagnosis
for life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating diseases or conditions. This designation grantsGASTROClear
TMthe advantage of an expedited review process by the FDA, potentially
resulting in accelerated market access. Furthermore, our experience in developingGASTROClear
TMhas been used as a valuable reference for the drafting of miRNA molecular
detection industry standards, including the SS 656: 2020 Singapore standard, demonstrating itsoutstanding clinical performance.
We believe that GASTROClear
TMis a unique offering in the market that disrupts existing
early gastric cancer screening paradigm. It is a non-invasive, cost effective, more accessibleand convenient option compared to traditional early screening technologies, with strongperformance. We completed a large-scale prospective clinical trial for GASTROClear
TMwith
5,282 subjects in Singapore, being one of the few largest prospective clinical trials globally forcancer screening and early detection that have been conducted, according to Frost & Sullivan.With the area under curve (“ AUC ”) value of 0.85, which significantly outperforms the existing
gastric cancer screening biomarkers (with AUC of 0.63 to 0.65), we believe GASTROClear
TM
has shown comparable performance to gastro-endoscopy, which is currently the gold standardof gastric cancer early detection and diagnostics. The results from the prospective clinical trialof GASTROClear
TMhave demonstrated a high overall sensitivity of 87.0%, and a remarkable
sensitivity of 87.5% for stage I gastric cancers and 75.0% for early lesions less than 1 cm,respectively, which suggests a significant potential in ultra-early detection. GASTROClear
TM
showed a specificity of 68.4% in the clinically relevant trial population that included healthyaverage-risk individuals as well as individuals with atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia.As such, GASTROClear
TMdemonstrated a negative prediction value (“ NPV ”) of 99.5% and a
positive prediction value (“ PPV ”) of 6.7%, which outperforms existing gastric cancer
screening biomarkers, and is comparable to cancer screening tests applied in other majorcancers. GASTROClear
TMis equipped with our mSMRT-qPCR technology and is capable of
rapid detection of 13 samples per use, with the detection results being available within fourhours in a PCR laboratory.SUMMARY
–3–THIS DOCUMENT IS IN DRAFT FORM, INCOMPLETE AND SUBJECT TO CHANGE AND THAT THE INFORMATION MUST

GASTROClear
TM
Gastric cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths in 2022 globally, and it is
ranked the sixth in terms of global incidences among all cancers in 2022 with a total ofapproximately 1.1 million incidences globally, according to Frost & Sullivan. It is widelyaccepted that gastric cancer is one of the most preventable cancers, because screening ofasymptomatic individuals is capable of identifying precancerous adenoma that can be removedthrough surgery before they become cancerous. Patients who are diagnosed early in theprogression of the disease are more likely to have a complete recovery and incur less medicalexpenses.
According to Frost & Sullivan, the market size of gastric cancer screening in the selected
regions (namely China, Japan, Southeast Asia and the U.S.) increased from US$11.6 billion in2018 to US$14.6 billion in 2022. It is expected to increase to US$20.7 billion in 2027 andfurther to US$24.3 billion in 2032.SUMMARY

CUSTOMERS
During the Track Record Period, we derived a majority of our revenues from our
GASTROClear
TMtests and FortitudeTMKit. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022
and the four months ended April 30, 2023, the aggregate revenue generated from our fivelargest customers were US$55.8 million, US$7.6 million and US$2.5 million, representing92.0%, 42.7% and 43.7% of our revenue, respectively. Revenues generated from our largestcustomer for the same periods were US$40.0 million, US$2.3 million and US$0.9 million,representing 65.9%, 13.1% and 15.6% of our revenue, respectively. Our five largest customersin 2021, 2022 and the first four months in 2023 primarily included government agencies,healthcare platforms, hospitals, and medical device and biotech enterprises. As we furtherincrease market penetration of GASTROClear
TMand FortitudeTMKit in Singapore and other
jurisdictions and expand our commercialization channels, we expect the percentage of theaggregate revenue generated from our five largest customers out of our total consolidatedrevenue will decrease. We generally allow for a credit period of up to one month, and forcertain customers we may grant an extended credit term of up to twelve months. For details,see “Business – Customers.”
RAW MATERIALS AND SUPPLIERS
During the Track Record Period, our suppliers primarily consisted of (i) suppliers of our
raw materials for production and testing services; (ii) CROs, who provide third-partycontracting services for research and development; and (iii) suppliers of fixed assets forresearch and development activities, machines and equipment for our production and testingservices. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022 and the four months ended April30, 2023, the aggregate purchases from our five largest suppliers were US$11.4 million,US$14.9 million and US$1.6 million, accounting for 59.9%, 48.4% and 42.5% of our totalpurchases, respectively. Purchases from our largest supplier for the same periods were US$3.7million, US$4.8 million and US$0.6 million, representing 19.6%, 15.7% and 16.5% of our totalpurchases, respectively. For details, see “Business – Raw Materials and Suppliers”.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS
Intellectual property rights are important to our business. Our future commercial success
depends, in part, on our ability to obtain and maintain patents and other intellectual propertyand proprietary protections for commercially important technologies, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, preserve the confidentiality of ourtrade secrets, and operate without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the valid,enforceable intellectual property rights of third parties.SUMMARY
–1 4–THIS DOCUMENT IS IN DRAFT FORM, INCOMPLETE AND SUBJECT TO CHANGE AND THAT THE INFORMATION MUST
BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE SECTION HEADED “WARNING” ON THE COVER OF THIS DOCUMENT.As of the Latest Practicable Date, we owned or in-licensed 17 patent families at different
stages of maturity comprising 24 issued patents and 63 pending patent applications, all ofwhich are invention patents and patent applications. As of the Latest Practicable Date, weowned or in-licensed 12 issued and published patents, as well as 25 pending patentapplications, that are related to our Core Product.
The term of an individual patent may vary based on the countries/regions in which it is
granted. In most countries and regions in which we file patent applications, includingSingapore, China and the United States, the term of an issued invention patent is generally 20years from the filing date of the earliest non-provisional patent application on which the patentis based in the applicable country. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened insome cases by a patent term adjustment, which extends the term of a patent to account foradministrative delays by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, in excessof a patent applicant’s own delays during the prosecution process, or may be shortened if apatent is terminally disclaimed over a commonly-owned patent having an earlier expirationdate. For details, see “Business – Intellectual Property Rights.”
During the Track Record Period and up to the Latest Practicable Date, we were not
involved in any material proceedings in respect of, and we had not received notice of anymaterial claims of infringement of, any intellectual property rights that are threatened orpending, in which we may be a claimant or a respondent.

We had net current assets of US$29.7 million as of December 31, 2022, compared to net
current assets of US$107.7 million as of December 31, 2021. The significant decrease wasprimarily due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents from US$102.2 million as ofDecember 31, 2021 to US$19.9 million as of December 31, 2022, as a result of the increasein operating costs, acquisition of new business, and the investment in building newmanufacturing and laboratory infrastructure.
We had net current assets of US$12.1 million as of April 30, 2023, compared to net
current assets of US$29.7 million as of December 31, 2022. The change was primarilyattributable to 1) a decrease in cash and cash equivalents from US$19.9 million as of December31, 2022 to US$10.7 million as of April 30, 2023, as a result of an increase in operating costs,and 2) an increase in trade and other payables from US$14.9 million as of December 31, 2022to US $16.6 million as of April 30, 2023, as a result of our stronger bargaining power to obtainmore favorable credit periods from our suppliers.
We had net current assets of US$7.1 million as of May 31, 2023, being the latest
practicable date for the purpose of liquidity disclosure in this Document, and compared to netcurrent assets of US$12.1 million as of April 30, 2023. The change was primarily due to anincrease in trade and other payables from US$16.6 million as of April 30, 2023 to US$19.2million as of May 31, 2023 as a result of lingering impacts of favorable credit periods grantedto us.

as the major sources of liquidity. We also generate cash from sales of Fortitude

business develops and expands, we expect to generate more net cash from our operatingactivities, through increasing sales of our commercialized products and services and launchingnew products, as a result of the broader market acceptance of our existing products and ourcontinued efforts in marketing and expansion, and improving cost control and operatingefficiency.SUMMARY

profit margin decreased for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to that for the yearended December 31, 2021, primarily due to lower margins of our Infectious Diseases businesssegment. Our gross profit margin increased from 40.7% for the four months ended April 30,2022 to 49.3% for the four months ended April 30, 2023, primarily due to the increase inrevenue generated from the Early Detection and Precision Multi-omics business segment witha higher gross profit margin, as compared to the Infectious Diseases business segment.

and other distributions on equity from our Singapore and PRC subsidiaries to satisfy ourliquidity requirements. Current PRC regulations permit our PRC subsidiaries to pay dividendsto us only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRCaccounting standards and regulations. In addition, our PRC subsidiaries are required to setaside at least 10.0% of their respective accumulated profits each year, if any, to fund certainreserve funds until the total amount set aside reaches 50.0% of their respective registeredcapital. Our PRC subsidiaries may also allocate a portion of its after-tax profits based on PRCaccounting standards to employee welfare and bonus funds at their discretion. These reservesare not distributable as cash dividends. Furthermore, if our PRC subsidiaries incur debt on theirown behalf in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict their ability to paydividends or make other payments to us. In addition, the PRC tax authorities may require usto adjust our taxable income under the contractual arrangements we currently have in place ina manner that would materially and adversely affect our PRC subsidiaries’ ability to paydividends and other distributions to us. Under Singapore law, no dividend shall be payable toshareholders of any company except out of profits. Any final dividends declared must beapproved by an ordinary resolution of shareholders at a general meeting. Dividends shall notbe paid in excess of the amount recommended by the board. The board may, without theapproval of the shareholders, also declare interim dividends. Singapore adopts the one-tiercorporate taxation system (the “One-Tier System”). Under the One-Tier System, the taxcollected from corporate profits is a final tax and the after-tax profits of the company residentin Singapore can be distributed to the shareholders as tax-exempt dividends. Such dividendsare tax-exempt in the hands of the shareholders, regardless of whether the shareholder is acompany or an individual and whether or not the shareholder is a Singapore tax resident.
We currently expect to retain all future earnings for use in the operation and expansion
of our business and do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Anydeclaration and payment as well as the amount of dividends will be subject to our constitutionaldocuments and the Cayman Companies Act. The declaration and payment of any dividends inthe future may be determined by our Board as it thinks fit, and will depend on a number offactors, including our earnings, capital requirements, overall financial condition andcontractual restrictions. Our shareholders in a general meeting may approve any declaration ofdividends, which must not exceed the amount recommended by our Board. As advised by ourCayman counsel, under the Cayman Islands law, a Cayman Islands company may pay adividend out of either profits or share premium account, provided that in no circumstances maya dividend be paid if this would result in the company being unable to pay its debts as they falldue in the ordinary course of business. In light of our accumulated losses as disclosed in thisDocument, it is unlikely that we will be eligible to pay a dividend out of our profits in theforeseeable future. We may, however, pay a dividend out of our share premium account unlessthe payment of such a dividend would result in our Company being unable to pay our debts asthey fall due in the ordinary course of business. There is no assurance that dividends of anyamount will be declared to be distributed in any year.SUMMARY

We are an RNA technology company that is making diagnostic solutions for the early
detection of diseases (the “ Relevant Businesses ”), which involves the development and
application of gene diagnostic and therapeutic technologies, and therefore fall into the scopeof the “prohibited” category of the Relevant PRC Regulations. As such, we currently do notdirectly or indirectly hold any equity interest in our Consolidated Affiliated Entities which areinvolved in the Relevant Businesses.
In order to comply with the PRC laws and regulations and maintain effective control over
the Relevant Businesses, a series of Contractual Arrangements has been entered into among (i)Hangzhou Miwei, Hangzhou Miyin, Hangzhou Mirui, Hangzhou Mian and the IndividualRegistered Shareholders, and (ii) Hangzhou Miwei, Linuokang Lab and the RegisteredShareholders, respectively, pursuant to which Hangzhou Miwei acquired effective control overthe finance and operations of our Consolidated Affiliated Entities and is entitled to all theeconomic benefits derived from their operations. See “Contractual Arrangements.”

Consolidated Affiliated Entities to our Group stipulated under the Contractual Arrangementsafter completion of the Reorganization:

BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE SECTION HEADED “WARNING” ON THE COVER OF THIS DOCUMENT.Conducting operations through contractual arrangements has been adopted by many
PRC-based companies, and has been adopted by our Company in the form of the ContractualArrangements, to establish control of our Consolidated Affiliated Entities, through which weoperate the Relevant Businesses in the PRC. The FIL does not explicitly stipulate thecontractual arrangements as a form of foreign investment or explicitly prohibit or restrict aforeign investor to rely on contractual arrangements to control the majority of its business thatis subject to foreign investment restrictions or prohibitions in the PRC. As advised by our PRCLegal Adviser, since the Contractual Arrangements are not specified as foreign investmentunder the FIL, if future laws, regulations and provisions prescribed by the State Council do notincorporate contractual arrangements as a form of foreign investment, our ContractualArrangements as a whole and each of the agreements comprising the Contractual Arrangementsdo not contravene the FIL in any material aspect, and will not be affected and will continue tobe legal, valid and binding on the parties with an exception that an arbitral body has no powerto grant injunctive relief and may not directly issue a provisional or final liquidation order forthe purpose of protecting the assets of or equity interests in the Consolidated Affiliated Entitiesin case of disputes, and that interim remedies or enforcement orders granted by overseas courtssuch as the courts of Hong Kong and the Cayman Islands may not be recognizable orenforceable in the PRC. See ‘‘– Legality of the Contractual Arrangements.”
If the operation of our Relevant Businesses is not on the “negative list” and we can legally
operate such businesses under PRC laws, Hangzhou Miwei will exercise the option under theExclusive Option Agreement to acquire the equity interest of our Consolidated AffiliatedEntities and unwind the contractual arrangements subject to re-approval by the relevantauthorities.
Furthermore, although its implementing rules do not expressly stipulate the contractual
arrangements as a form of foreign investment, there are possibilities that future laws,administrative regulations or provisions prescribed by the State Council may regard contractualarrangements as a form of foreign investment, at which time it will be uncertain whether theContractual Arrangements will be deemed to be in violation of the foreign investment accessrequirements and how the above-mentioned Contractual Arrangements will be handled.Therefore, there is no guarantee that the Contractual Arrangements and the business of theConsolidated Affiliated Entities will not be materially and adversely affected in the future dueto changes in PRC laws and regulations. In the event that such measures are not complied with,the Stock Exchange may take enforcement actions against us which may have a materialadverse effect on the [ REDACTED ] of our Shares.

Contractual Arrangements.”SUMMARY
