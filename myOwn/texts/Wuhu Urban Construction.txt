OVERVIEW
We are a fast-growing state-owned constru ction and municipal infrastructure O&M
(‘‘O&M ’’) services provider based in Wuhu City, Anhui Province, having over 35 years’
operating history with solid footprint in W uhu City and increasing market presence in

Engineering Management Office underwent a structural reform ( 管養分離改革)a n d
separated its (i) management function from its ( ii) municipal infrastructure construction
and O&M functions. Accordingly, our Company was established to engage in the provisionof municipal infrastructure construction and O&M services in Wuhu City in 2015.Leveraging on our experience and expertise on construction, we started to commence ourbuilding construction business in 2016. According to F&S, (i) we had a market share of0.3% in terms of building construction and municipal infrastructure construction revenue

Revenue
Our Group’s revenue is mainly generated from (i) construction business, which
comprises of building construction business a nd municipal infrastructure construction
business; (ii) O&M business; and (iii) othe r business. Our reven ue generated from
construction business amounted to RMB25 8.9 million, RMB792.2 million, RMB1,921.7
million, RMB430.2 million and RMB831.2 m illion for FY2020, FY 2021, FY2022, 4M2022
and 4M2023, respectively, representing 50.4%, 73.0%, 86.7%, 81.7% and 88.8% of ourtotal revenue.
Revenue generated from construction business increased significantly by RMB533.3
million or 206.0% from RMB258.9 million for FY2020 to RMB792.2 million for FY2021.
Such increase was mainly due to (i) the expansion of our construction business to Bozhou
City and we recognised an aggre gate revenue of RMB215.7 m illion from such projects in
FY2021; (ii) the commencement of sizeable const ruction projects (i.e. with original contract
sum over RMB100 million) in FY2021, given th at the number of contracts of original
contract sum over RMB100 million increased from five in FY2020 to nine in FY2021; and
(iii) the absence of elimination of intra-gro up transactions prior to 2021 Transfer. The
increase in revenue was partia lly offset by, among others, (i) the completion of certain
projects in FY2020 and (ii) the decrease in revenue generated by some projects in FY2021,as compared to FY2020.
Revenue generated from construction business increased significantly by RMB1,129.5
million or 142.6% from RMB792.2 million for FY2021 to RMB1,921.7 million for FY2022.
The notable increment was mainly because, among others, (i) the commencement of
large-scale construction projects (i.e. with original contract sum over RMB500 million) inFY2021, and (ii) the absence of elimination of i ntra-group transactions prior to the 2021
Transfer; and (iii) we participated in certain size able construction projects (i.e. with original
contract sum over RMB100 million). The increa se in revenue was partially offset by, among
others, the decrease in revenue due to (i) completion of one sizeable project in FY2021 and(ii) substantial part of our work in another sizeable project was completed in FY2021.
For 4M2023, our revenue generated from construction business increased by
RMB401.0 million or 93.2% from RMB430.2 million for 4M2022 to RMB831.2 million
for 4M2023. The increment was mainly becaus e, among others, the commencement of two
large-scale projects (i.e. with original con tract sum over RMB500 million) in the second half
of FY2022. Such increase was partially offset by the decrease in revenue generated by one
sizeable project in 4M2023, as compared to 4M2022.SUMMARY

FY2020, FY2021, FY2022, 4M2022 and 4M2023, respectively, representing 49.1%, 26.6%,
13.2%, 18.3% and 10.8% of our total revenue.
Revenue generated from O&M projects s lightly increased by RMB36.3 million or
14.4% from RMB252.1 million for FY2020 to RMB288.4 million for FY2021. Such
increase was mainly due to, among others, the enlarged market presence through our
expansion of O&M business to Bozhou City.
Revenue generated from O&M projects remained stable at RMB288.4 million for
FY2021 and RMB293.2 million for FY2022, w ith our revenue generated from O&M
projects also remained stable at RMB96. 6 million for 4M2022 and RMB101.4 million for
4M2023.
Gross profit and gross profit margins
Our gross profit for FY2020, FY2021, FY2022, 4M2022 and 4M2023 were RMB169.4
million, RMB202.6 million, RMB207.9 million, RMB53.0 million and RMB82.8 million,
respectively, and our gross profit margin for the corresponding periods were 33.0%, 18.7%,
9.4%, 10.1% and 8.9%, respectively.
For FY2020, FY2021, FY2022, 4M2022 and 4M2023, our gross profits of building
construction business were RMB0.9 mil lion, RMB19.9 million, RMB77.7 million,
RMB16.8 million and RMB41.0 million, respecti vely, and our gross profit margin for the
corresponding periods were 1.0%, 4.6%, 5.2%, 5.1% and 5.5%, respectively. Our gross
profit margin of building construction b usiness was low at 1.0% for FY2020 when
compared with those of FY2021, FY2022, 4M2022 and 4M2023. It was primarily because of
the low gross profit margin yielded by a major project in this business segment in FY2020,
namely Jinghu District PPP Project. This project contributed revenue in the sum of
RMB62.6 million for FY2020 and accounted for 72.5% of the total revenue of our building
construction business for FY2020. Our gross profit margins of building construction
remained stable at around 5% for FY2021, FY2022, 4M2022 and 4M2023.
For FY2020, FY2021, FY2022, 4M2022 and 4M2023, our gross profits of municipal
infrastructure construction business we re RMB40.9 million, RMB47.3 million, RMB48.5
million, RMB8.7 million and RMB9.8 million, resp ectively, and our gross profit margin for
the corresponding periods were 23.7%, 13.0%, 11.7%, 8.6% and 10.6%, respectively. Ourgross profit margins of municipal infrastructure construction business generally
demonstrated a decreasing trend during FY2020, FY2021 and FY2022. Such trend was
primarily a combined result of (i) the relatively low gross profit margins of projects
obtained through public tendering when compared with those obtained through other
methods, such as negotiation and (ii) our increasing number of projects awarded by tender
during FY2020, FY2021 and FY2022. Our gross profit margins of municipal infrastructure
construction business increased from 8.6% for 4M2022 to 10.6% for 4M2023, which was
mainly attributed to, among others, the incr ease in gross profit margins for 4M2023 as
compared to 4M2022 in respect of one particular project as it incurred higher raw materials
costs and specialised subcontracting costs inc urred at the initial stage of the project during
4M2022.
For FY2020, FY2021, FY2022, 4M2022 and 4M2023, our gross profit of O&M
business were RMB127.4 million, RMB134.1 million, RMB82.1 million, RMB27.4 million
and RMB32.1 million, respectively, and our gr oss profit margin for the corresponding
periods were 50.5%, 46.5%, 28.0%, 28.4% and 31.6%, respectively. The general decreasing
trend of our gross profit margins of O&M business throughout the Track Record Period
were mainly attributable to our historical t ies with Wuhu Management Engineering Office
and our commitment to expand the geographical location of our O&M business outside
Wuhu City and our diversification within Wu hu City into district-level and other O&M
projects.SUMMARY

a full year of operations.
For FY2021, our return on assets increased from 3.2% in FY2020 to 6.7% mainly
resulted from the decrease in total assets caused by the 2021 Transfer. For FY2022, our
return on assets slightly increased to 7.0% w hich remained stable as compared to FY2021.
For FY2021, our return on equity increased from 15.7% in FY2020 to 22.2% mainly
due to the increase in net profit and the decrease in equity. For FY2022, our return onequity further increased to 30.5%, mainly because of the decrease in equity.
Our interest coverage ratio increased from 7.8 times for FY2020 to 8.8 times for
FY2021 mainly because of the de crease in interest expenses incurred by our Transferred
Subsidiaries in respect of their real estate projects. Following the 2021 Transfer, we no
longer engage in real estate development busin ess, which is capital intensive. Our interest
coverage ratio for FY2022 increased significantly to 233.1 times from 8.8 times for FY2021.Our interest coverage ratio further increased to 1,991.8 times for 4M2023 mainly because ofthe further decrease in interest expenses.
Our gearing ratio decreased from 23.7% as at 31 December 2020 to 0.5% as at 31
December 2021 mainly due to the decrease in bank borrowings held by our one of theTransferred Subsidiaries, Chengbang Engineer ing, as its equity interest was transferred to
Zhongjiang Group pursuant to the 2021 Transfer. Our gearing ratio remained at a relativelylow level of 0.7% and 2.4% as at 31 December 2022 and 30 April 2023.
